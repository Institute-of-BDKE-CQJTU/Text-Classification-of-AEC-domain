On july 23 2009 employee #1 with sully-miller contracting co was installing new underground water lines. He placed 4 in. Steel pipe which was 10 ft long into the 8-ft-long bucket of a backhoe (john deere model number 710g) employee #1 then stood on the pipe to secure it. He placed his left hand on top of the bucket and debris guard and directed the backhoe operator to curl the bucket. Employee #1's finger was pinched between the arm of the bucket and the debris guard. His was treated at citrus valley medical center and then western hand center. The finger was surgically removed on july 23 2009. One factor in this accident was a damaged debris guard on the backhoe.,0
On september 24 2007 employee #1 and two coworkers were engaged in installing water pumps and piping at a pump station. In this process it was necessary to vertically join together 10 ft long assemblies consisting of three parts. The innermost part was a metal water pipe with an approximately 20 in. Diameter. These assemblies weighed several hundred pounds and were handled using an overhead hoist operated electrically by an operator with a direct line of sight to the assembly crew. The stainless steel axle when fully assembled is driven by an overhead motor and is used to activate an impeller that drives water vertically up the water pipe. The 7 in. Metal axle housing protects the axle and weighs approximately 200 lb per 10 ft section. The outermost water pipe carries water upward to large pumps for transportation through larger water lines. It has collars welded inside it just large enough to allow the axle housing to be held firmly in place when installed. At the time of the accident the stainless steel axle had been lowered and connected to the axle section below it. The operator was lowering the axle housing to be threaded into the coupling on the housing section below it when the axle housing section became caught on a collar inside the outermost water pipe. This resulted in some slack in the hoist chain that was not visible inside the water pipe. Not seeing the next section of the axle housing employee #1 put his hand into the water pipe to locate the axle housing thinking it was secured by the hoist. At that instant the axle housing slid through the water pipe collar catching employee #1's thumb between the edge of the falling axle housing and the axle housing coupling below. His thumb was partially amputated and he was transported to the hospital for treatment.,0
At approximately 12:50 p.m. on november 14 2011 employee #1 and coworkers were involved in a hydrostatic testing project which required the excavation of a street to remove and replace faulty high-pressure valves. A request was given to retrieve an end shore jack in the excavation site. Employee #1 choked a lifting strap around the middle of the end shore jack where a hook on a backhoe was to be connected. A coworker operated the backhoe. As employee #1 positioned the hook on the strap the backhoe operator moved the hoist up which suddenly jerked the hook and the strap upward. Employee #1's left thumb was caught between the hook and the strap amputating the tip of his thumb. The backhoe operator reported that he could not clearly see employee #1; however other employees stated otherwise. Further one of the employees stated that employee #1 was standing on the pipe above the jack being removed so the top of his head was at the street level. After the incident employee #1 was transported to a medical center where he underwent procedures for finger amputation and was hospitalized for postoperative care.,0
On september 30 2013 employee #1 a 47-year-old male with cramer and associates inc. was engaged in patch work activities on the bottom side of the bridge deck and was working from a jlg model number 600aj 4wd articulating boom lift that was approximately 20-to-25 ft above grade. Employee #1 lowered himself to obtain additional equipment from a coworker. Employee #1 was elevating himself in the man basket to return to work on bottom side of bridge deck while the coworker went to talk to a railroad flagger who was approximately 300 ft away. The coworker returned to the jlg that employee #1 was operating and observed that employee #1 was pinned between jlg guardrail system and the bridge girder employee #1was draped over the controls of the jlg. The coworker contacted two other workers at the site to assist with the rescue of employee #1 and the workers performed cpr on employee #1 until an ambulance arrived on scene.

Employee #1 was transported to the hospital admitted and treated for three finger amputations (index ring and pinky fingers) and damage to the tendons of the middle finger of his right hand. The san francisco fire department reported this incident to cal/osha which began its investigation august 22 2013. The investigator determined that employee #1 had more than 27 years of carpentry experience and was knowledgeable in the use and hazards of table saws. During the interview employee #1 asserted that he had not removed the blade guard (hood assembly). He did acknowledge that he was not using a push stick because he did not think it was necessary. The investigation report stated that if the guard was not removed the primary cause of this accident was the failure to use a push stick. Because the employee was working alone and the employer was not present the employer's knowledge could not be established. Therefore no serious accident-related violation was issued. The employer was cited for failure to timely report the serious injury to the district office of cal-osha.,0
At approximately 3:00 p.m. on september 26 2011 employee #1 a pipe layer was in an excavation approximately 10 ft underground. Another employee a backhoe operator was standing at the backhoe's controls lowering a 48 in. Concrete manhole base weighing approximately 2 500 lbs into the excavation by a sling on a backhoe bucket. The backhoe operator's vest caught on the control levers and as he sat down the manhole base on the sling swung up against employee #1 and pinned him between the load and the side of the excavation. The backhoe operator then dropped the base causing the concrete manhole to scrape the lower left leg of employee #1 and land on his left foot. Employee #1 did not seek medical attention until october 4 2011. He was hospitalized for a serious infection. (note: event date states 10/04/2011.

At approximately 7:30 a.m. on september 17 2013 employee #1 and coworker #1 employed by a plumbing contractor were working at an aerospace manufacturing plant. Employee #1 a plumber's assistant was assembling a pipe section to a ball valve. He was using a pipe and bolt threading machine ridge tool company model 1822-i. This machine is operated by a foot- switch pedal. The foot-switch pedal is like the gas pedal of a car: when you step on it the machine starts rotating; when you step off it the machine stops rotating. Employee #1 was using the machine to grip the pipe in a fixed position. He was using his right hand to thread the valve onto the stationary section of the pipe. Employee #1 had his right hand on the pipe and under the ball valve. He unintentionally activated the machine via the foot-switch pedal. The machine started to rotate and the pipe rotated toward employee #1. His fingers were trapped between the valve handle and the valve body. Employee #1 immediately either released the foot-switch pedal or kicked it away. Coworker #1 who was approximately 5 feet away came and turned off the machine using the on/off-type switch on the side of the machine. However the machine had already rotated enough to break employee #1 right index finger by bending it backwards. Emergency services were called and employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he underwent surgery to repair the fractured right index finger. The subsequent investigation of this event determined that the injury was caused by the machine unintentionally being activated by employee #1 via the foot pedal while his hand was on the pipe being gripped by the pipe and bolt threading machine. Employee #1 was a full-time employee of the employer.,0
On november 12 2013 employee #1 a concrete pump operator with maxicrete inc. dba maxicrete was cleaning the equipment (putzmeister; model number: tk-50 mobile concrete pump) at the end of the day using a garden hose.

As a reflex action the employee reached for the auger to stabilize it and his right middle finger was severed between the auger and the rig. He was transported to university medical center where he was hospitalized.,0
On may 31 1991 employee #1 a premium adjuster for the westvaco envelope company was working on a w and d envelope making machine #24941. While jogging the machine the tips of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand were amputated. He was hospitalized at the western hand clinic for 3 days and then treated as an outpatient. There was no guard to protect the point of operation.,0
At 1:25 p.m. on july 7 2007 employees #1 and #2 were working at a large commercial construction site in san bernandino ca. Employee #1 was in a 60 ft jlg aerial lift model #660sj serial #03-00060394 welding ledger angles on the south wall at the northwest corner of a room in building #1. The ledger angles were 21 ft 6 in. Above the earthen ground. After welding a ledger angle on the north side of an i-beam employee #1 was moving the boom's basket underneath the i-beam toward the beam's south side when he inadvertently pinned himself between the beam's bottom flange and top rail of the basket. Employee #1 sustained crushing injuries to his neck and chest. Employee #2 also an ironworker climbed up the 30 ft long extended boom of the aerial lift to rescue employee #1. He tried using the lift controls to lower the basket when it suddenly surged and shook pinning employee #2's left arm and left ribs between the south side of the i-beam and the control panel of the basket. Both men were transported to loma linda university medical center for treatment. Employee #1 died at approximately 2:10 p.m. that samew day. Employee #2 underwent surgery for a severely fractured left arm.,0
At approximately 8:30 a.m. on march 29 2013 employee #1 was unloading an auger extension tool from a truck. The employee's finger was lacerated when it was caught by the auger extension tool. Employee #1 was taken by a coworker to sutter general hospital where he was treated for a right middle finger amputation. Employee #1 remained hospitalized.,0
At approximately 1:00 p.m. on december 30 2005 employee #1 was working from a make shift scaffolding on the inside of an elevator shaft area located on the first floor. He was removing asbestos from the area. As employee #1 was working the elevator car which was above him descended due to lack of hydraulic pressure. Employee #1 was pinned under the elevated car and was killed. The immediate cause of death was asphyxia. Employee #1 was not protected from the elevated car since he did not secure the pressure control valve at the base of the elevator hydraulic cylinder. He also did not secure the hydraulic system from being activated or reenergized. In addition employee #1 did not shore supports under the elevated car to ensure that the car stayed elevated.,0
At approximately 3:30 p.m. on june 27 2012 employee #1 and coworker #1 full-time employees of zim industries inc. dba bakersfield well & pump co. were working in a nut orchard where their employer had been hired to drill a water well. They were sitting a sample box on a mud pit using a chain attached to the forks of a powered industrial lift truck john deere model jd486-4wd-21-6 s/n: t0486ex842243 rated capacity: 6 000 lbs unit # b932. Employee #1 was standing on the right fender of the lift truck and leaning forward between the mast upright and the overhead guard. Coworker #1 was sitting in the operator's seat of the lift truck. Employee #1's foot came into contact with the mast tilt control causing the mast to tilt in a reverse direction and pinning him between the mast upright and the overhead guard. Employee #1 sustained the following crush injuries: lacerated liver multiple left rib fractures adrenal hematoma right kidney laceration and multiple spinous process fractures. The causal factors were that employee #1 entered the area between the upright mast and the overhead guard and the upright mast tilted in a reverse direction crushing him in between the mast and the guard.,0
A 225-ton american crawler crane was being demobilized for shipment. Employee #1 was helping to wind the boom line whip line and main load line onto their base spools. Because there were no loads on the lines they were resistant to being rolled and tended to overlap or lay unevenly. Employee #1 was standing in a 34 in. Wide opening that was approximately 3 1/2 ft between the boom line and whip line spools and a metal guard/shield. The shield was an integral but not a structural part of the machine and it was intended to guard against workers falling into the rotating auxiliary shaft and clutch during normal maintenance of the crane. The whip line spool and boom line spool were on a common horizontal axis but rotated independently. The lines ran over the tops of the spools putting them slightly below employee #1's head as they were drawn from the horizontal boom. He guided the lines as necessary to yield an even tight lay. By this point the whip line had been secured and the boom line was being spooled at 16 rpm. Employee #1 was standing on a metal floor and apparently was astride the continuously rotating auxiliary 5 in. Diameter shaft. To one end of the shaft was attached a 27-in. Diameter friction clutch which operated the whip line spool and was open on the side closest to the employee. Employee #1 had on a safety belt with a shoulder harness and lanyard. It appears that employee #1's clothing or lanyard became caught in the rotating parts. The clutch continued to rotate approximately 3/4 turn after employee #1 alerted the operator that he was caught. He was pulled into a 13 in. Area and killed.,0
On may 19 2009 employee #1 may have inadvertently installed the winch cable hook to the safety cable as opposed to the transition plate of the hoist cables where it should have been attached. Because this equipment was being attached inside a light pole most of the installation was accomplished through touch because visibility was limited. Since the safety cable was also attached to the transition plate employee #1 may have thought the winch hook was properly installed and holding the hoist cables. Later when he reached into the light pole to release the winch hook from where he thought it was attached it slid down the safety cable under sufficient tension and severely injured the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center where he underwent treatment including amputations of the severely injured fingers and was released.,0
On october 23 2009 employee #1 was installing outdoor landscaping (fence lighting etc.). As he walked down a flight of stairs his right pinky finger became caught and was skinned. Employee #1 was taken to a nearby hospital where he was hospitalized and treated for his injury.,0
On august 13 2008 employee #1 was preparing to put a concrete plug in an underground concrete air return. The air return was 18-in. Wide and 36-in. Deep before it made a 90-degree turn and then traveled several feet under length of house. The employee was working alone and he entered the air return head first and got stuck. Employee #1 was unable to breath and died before being found by his boss several hours later.,0
At approximately 3:43 p.m. on december 2 2004 an employee was in the process of using a bobcat to place pea gravel in a crawlspace of a new single-family. He home noticed a hydraulic hose line had ruptured. The employee was working under the raised bucket full of pea gravel on the bobcat. The employee was trying to repair the ruptured hydraulic hose line by loosening another hydraulic hose line with a wrench to move it out of the way to repair the ruptured hose line. When the employee loosened the hydraulic hose line in the front the bucket full of pea gravel slowly fell on the employee crushing him between the cab and the bucket of the bobcat. The employee was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.,0
At approximately 10:40 a.m. on september 14 2011 employees #1 #2 #3 and #4 were working on a light duty scaffold (25 pounds/square foot) with 13 coworkers. All 17 employees were working for their employer a registered asbestos abatement contractor. The scaffold had been erected to remove asbestos prior to the demolition of the building. The scaffold collapsed and all 17 employees fell 18 feet to the ground. Emergency services were called and employees #1 through #4 were transported to a local hospital. Employees #1 and #2 were admitted for treatment of unspecified serious injuries sustained in the fall.,1
At approximately 12:57 p.m. on october 15 2012 employee #1 a foreman/carpenter was installing window trim on residential condominiums. He set a ladder to the edge of gutters that were approximately 20 ft above grade. He extended the ladder approximately 3 ft above the gutters to access a narrow roof area below the windows to be trimmed. According employee #1 he was making his first trip up the ladder using both hands to install a screw eye as an anchor point to tie off the ladder. When employee #1 was approximately 14 ft above grade the ladder became unstable and fell. A coworker saw employee #1 hanging onto the gutter momentarily and then falling to an asphalt surface. He was hospitalized at stanford hospital for a fractured ankle a fractured wrist and other injuries. Document review and employee statements indicate that this was routine employer policy prior to the incident. Employee #1 did not recall what may have caused the ladder to fall. The employer's work practices for safe ladder use including tie-off were in place during the inspection of the job site. Employee #1 stated that the intended location for his anchor point did not require him to lean to either side of the ladder. Employee #1 indicated he had inspected the ladder prior to use and that it was not damaged and was placed on a level surface. The superintendent on duty stated that the ladder was inspected after the fall and there was no observable damage.,1
"At about 1:15 pm on june 19 2006 employee #1 with a glass installation contractor was working at an auto dealership construction site. A large flatbed truck had arrived at the site with crates carrying 14 sheets of heavy-duty reinforced glass. Each sheet measured 4 ft by 8 ft was 0.5625-in.-thick and weighed about 350 lbs. Normally the sheets in their crates would be unloaded with a forklift. However the owner of the company had not been able to rent a forklift and the delivery driver indicated to the employer that he needed to leave to continue work. According to the police report the co-owner of the company admitted that he and the owner had agreed to ""loose lite"" the load that is unload each sheet individually by hand using suction discs. This procedure was normally used for smaller sheets that arrived on inclined racks on a smaller truck. The co-owner (the site supervisor) admitted to having concerns when he observed the way the load had been shipped and admitted that the company had never unloaded glass of that size by hand from a flatbed. At the time of the inspection it was observed that the main shipping crate was posted with a large sign stating ""do not open any case and attempt lite by lite unloading."" The company owner stated in an interview that he was aware that there is a safety regulation stating that materials being unloaded must be secured against dangerous displacement. At the time of the accident there were two employees up on the flatbed and a foreman and the supervisor/co-owner standing in the street. Employee #1 cut the bands holding the front covers of the crates and opened the first crate on the driver's side of the flatbed to begin to separate the sheets. A safety line consisting of a single nylon rope had been tied mid-way down one of the vertical supports of the crate holder. Before this rope was anchored the upright sheets began to tip over. According to witness statements employee #1 attempted to jump in front of the sheets to keep them from falling. He was knocked off the flatbed by the weight of the falling sheets and at least five sheets fell and crushed him on the street a distance of 4.6 ft. below the flatbed. He was killed.",1
"On may 12 2005 employee #1 of acorn industrial inc. was removing welds from a 30 in. Chr pipe in a utility tunnel so the pipe could be repositioned and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports spaced throughout the tunnel as well as by temporary ""trapeze"" supports mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place where employee #1 was working there was no permanent support in place. On the previous day a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this employee #1 and the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. Of the 30 in. Chr pipe at the west joint (including the misaligned weld) refit the two pipe ends and redo the weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all portions of it due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the rolling of the pipe three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were re-welded back in place but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After the tack welds cracked the second time the foreman and employee #1 decided to start over at the west joint. At this point employee #1 had completely severed the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told employee #1 to check his rigging and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in. Chr pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue layout for expansion joints in another vault and employee #1 and his helper continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds while they were at the bottom of the pipe instead of rolling the pipe to put the tack welds in a better position. At this point the only support for the pipe was the permanent support about 24 ft 4 in. Away and approximately 12 ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. At the east joint. Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it fell crushing his right arm against the 30 in. Chs pipe below. He suffered injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary ""trapeze"" support would have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a ross ""come-a-long"" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The ""come-a-long"" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe; it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----",1
Employee #1 was painting the inside of a 110 ft tall water tank when the rigging holding his powered boatswain's chair came loose. He was wearing a safety belt but his lifeline broke and he fell to the bottom of the tank. Employee #1 was killed.,1

At about 3:00 p.m. on july 9 2013 employee #1 a foreman with razmik tarkhanian dba bridge iron was securing a 22 ft wide by 65 ft long trellis between two buildings that were under construction. Employee #1 was working alone removing safety brackets with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) from the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1 decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest column. When the bottom weld was cut the weight of the trellis was too great for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis. This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately two ft and trap employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently the structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail under the load and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital and he was admitted for over 24 hours for chest and facial fractures.,1
On may 14 2003 an employee was standing in close proximity to an all terrain forklift being operated on wet soft ground when the forklift tipped on its side.

On december 19 2011 employee #1 an excavator operator of dh griffin company exited his cab and entered the excavation he was digging. The excavation site was a large swimming pool shaped open pit measuring approximately 34 feet by 75 feet and up to 13 feet at its deeper end. A wall of spoils pile dirt lined the southeastern wall of the excavation with a service road just wide enough for a skid steer to operate up and down the side of it. The north/western side was fairly open with the exception of one spoils pile of dirt left on a concrete pad at the excavation edge. Within 20 yards of this area employee #1 was operating to remove soil from the pit and loading it into the dump trailers that had backed up to this same area. Speculation was that employee #1 entered the excavation to examine an area where a foul fuel-like odor emanated from a recently removed bucket of soil. Within seconds of entering the excavation the side wall exploded outward striking employee #1 from behind and burying him completely. Witnesses to the event quickly ran to his aid in an effort to free him from the soil. Emergency services arrived to complete the rescue efforts and transported him to the hospital. Employee # 1 was later pronounced dead. He had sustained fatal injuries from the weight of the soil as it struck him to body and head.,1

At approximately 10:19 a.m. on december 12 2007 employee #1 a painter was painting the walls on the north side of a two-story home. He climbed to the third level of a scaffold to prep a section of the wall. As he climbed down and leaned against the back rail it gave way and he fell over 20 ft to the grass lawn. Employee #1 was transported by hall ambulance to kern medical center in bakersfield ca. Employee #1 later stated that a connector hook on the back railing was disconnected from a scaffold upright which would have weakened the supporting capacity of the railing. At the time of the accident employee #1 was working with or near a coworker and his immediate supervisor. Subsequent investigation concluded that the supervisor did not perform a thorough survey of the site to assess the hazards and take appropriate action. The employer was cited for a violation of construction safety order 1511(b).,1
At approximately 11:15 a.m. on october 14 2010 employee #1 was trying to find the existing water line so that he could install a connecting water line leading to a new building. There was an existing trench that measured 2.5-ft by 3.83-ft by 19.83-ft and the employer was using a backhoe to reach a depth of 9 feet in the trench. Employee #1 was digging with a shovel in the bottom of the excavation when the wall that was underneath the spoil pile caved in and he was engulfed. The employer tried using the backhoe in an attempt to free employee #1. It was determined that employee #1 died from a laceration of the aorta from the backhoe.,1
On september 13 2012 employee #1 a framer was assigned to install joist on an entryway bridge. The employee was unknowing tied off to a main load-bearing beam that was improperly installed.

At approximately 9:00 a.m. on june 29 2005 employee #1 a construction laborer was working under supervision of two supervisors at the construction site located in san diego california. Employee #1 attempted to climb up two vertical bundles of stacked simon forms. The bundles were stacked in sets of nine forms each called panels and were approximately 49-in. High 6-ft long 3-ft wide and weighed approximately 500 lbs. One bundle of nine forms which was at the bottom was stacked on top of another bundle of nine panels for a total height of 98 in. From the top of a flatbed truck to the top edge of the 18th panel. The distance from the pavement to the top of the flatbed truck was 36 in. Employee #1 was rigging up a sling around the top bundle so a crane could remove the top bundle from the flatbed truck. Employee #1 was climbing up the side of the two vertical bundles which were made of 18 panels stacked on top of each other. He was stepping on the edge of the panels with his feet and pulling himself up with his hands on the bands that surrounded the bundled forms. When employee #1 was pulling himself up over the 9th panel of the second vertical stacked bundle the banded bundle of panels shifted towards him. Employee #1 fell backwards 6 to 7 ft to the pavement.

On july 6 2010 three male carpenters were replacing the roof on a two-story commercial building. The carpenters whose ages ranged from 24-57 were working from tubular-welded frame scaffolding which was located at the second floor level. With the majority of the new trusses in place a loud noise was heard and the trusses began collapsing along with the adjacent wall of the structure. All three workers received multiple injuries as they were struck-by and caught between falling truss members masonry units and the scaffolds themselves. Among the injuries sustained were: a foot fracture nerve damage to the hand and arm motor function and numerous bruises and laceration. All were transported to the emergency room but none were hospitalized. Site inspection revealed a number of deficiencies in the truss construction dealing with stabilization bracing and anchoring to the building's masonry walls.,1
Employee #1 was using a roller-type compactor to compress soil in a trench when he was trapped against the trench wall. His leg was broken below the knee.,1
At approximately 3:00 p.m. on december 5 2012 a serious accident occurred at jobsite where employee #1 was engaged in drilling piles for a secant pile shoring system for an excavation. On the day of the accident employee #1 set a ladder up against a casing in order to attach the rigging from the forklift to the casing. The ground that day was muddy and about half way up the ladder the casing fell away from him. It hit the counterweight of the drill rig and ended up landing across his left leg and lower torso. Employee #1 suffered a crushed pelvis a compound fracture of his left femur a severed femoral artery and a torn colon.,1
At approximately 3:00 p.m. on january 28 2011 the employee was installing rafters from a plywood platform placed at about 16 feet high atop a rolling scaffold. He was fastening the rafters onto a cantilevered ridge beam. There were no guardrails on the work platform. Another employee was assisting the rafter installation by fastening the lower end of the rafters at the top plate of the 1st story. A coworker was operating an excavator atop a soil pile that had been built to enable the excavator to lift the rafter beams up to the workers. After lifting the rafters the operator began to use the excavator to scrape up soil that had been displaced around the soil pile and reportedly struck a support brace for the structure once. A witness who was spotting for the excavator operator and other employees stated they warned the operator that he was getting too close to the structure and that he acknowledged their warning. While continuing to operate the excavator to scrape up soil in the area the coworker stated that his vision became obscured by the afternoon sun and the boom of the excavator hit the ridge beam. This collapsed the roof structure including the rafters one of which struck the employee and knocked him off of the scaffold. He fell about 16 feet to the grade level below and his right leg was impaled upon an unprotected anchor bolt extending through the sill plate. The employee was transferred to stanford hospital where he was admitted and treated for the puncture wound a broken rib on his right side and multiple contusions and scrapes.,1
At approximately 8:45 a.m. on july 9 2007 employee #1 was helping to disassemble a crane. Employee #1 took out the three bolts that secure the rear counterweight to the middle counterweight and was loosening the second counterweight's bolts from under the super structure. Another employee was standing directly behind the crane assisting in the operation stated that they had not been trained in the assembly and or disassembly of the crane and did not consider the bolts being removed a hazard. The operator of the crane leading the disassembly stated he did not know employee #1 had taken the bolts off the counter weight and was working on releasing the gantry crane on the back of the crane to secure the counter weight. The operator's manual states that the counter weight should have been secured to the gantry before the bolts had been removed and/or loosened. The rear counter weight fell off striking employee #1. Employee #1 was crushed by the eight-ton rear counter weight from the hc-80 terex american crawler crane and was killed. .,1
On march 14 2002 employee #1 and four coworkers were involved in operations to set a double-wide mobile home in place after it had been transported to the site by a transport contractor. As employee #1 began to lower a jack on the underside of the double-wide home's back half. The operation was intended to slide the home's back half approximately 4 ft on rollers to make a connection with the double wide's front half. Come-alongs were also to have been used to bring the halves together. During the process the back half of the home shifted and began moving forward on the rollers (approx. 16 in to 18 in of movement). As a result of the premature movement employee #1 was killed when he was struck by a portion of the home's underside frame and sustained severe head injuries when his head fell on top of a cinder block and was struck and crushed by a floor joist (an outer wall support) on the homes underside.,1
At 10:30 p.m. on january 9 2013 employee #1 a crane operator employed by concrete general inc. along with coworker #1 a rigger and coworker #2 a laborer were using a mobile crane as part of a bridge repair project. The crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane the fast lane on one of two bridges the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury. He was transported to a hospital where he received treatment for a knee bruise/abrasion. He then was released. Maryland osha's investigation determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two bridges above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65 feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore the crane was being operated outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts. Employee #1 and his two coworkers were exposed to struck-by hazards while working with the mobile crane.,1
On september 18 2011 employees #1 and #2 of american builder construction co. worked inside a poorly shored trench for a retaining wall at a residential site digging an additional 2 feet for footings. The bracing on the shoring was on the high side of the hill. The excavation was over 5 feet high per employees as the shoring was above their heads with the dirt level with it. As the employees dug they threw the spoil on the high side. Since the bracing was on the high side the surcharge caused the hill to slide down pushing the shoring on the high side forward and pinning employee #1 between that side and the opposite side shoring. The trench collapsed. Employee #1 was killed in the accident. On the day of the accident there was no competent person on site. At approximately 2:30 p.m. the ventura county fire department notified osha of the collapse. Observation of the scene disclosed poor shoring construction techniques poor quality wood and surcharge on top of the hill. Background: the employees had originally dug a ledge on a hill to place a rebar cage for the foundation of a cinder block retaining wall. Three days before the accident the ventura county building and safety department inspector visited the site and informed the person in charge that the shoring and excavation were not being done properly there was surcharge and the whole site had to be engineered. He told the person in charge that the trench had to be dug an additional 2 feet for footings.,1

At approximately 11:20 a.m. on november 7 2013 employee #1 was operating an aerial lift and assisting a crew with the demolition of a 135 ft tall building. The crew consisted of a supervisor the owner of the company and two other employees that were working together to demo the building. The group had cut the top of four out of the five southwestern most main support beams earlier that day with no issues. They moved to the northwestern beams and began cutting the top of four out of five beams but could not get the i-beam piece out. After breaking a new 0.625 in. Diameter choker they tried to extract the piece out but could not. It was then decided by the owner supervisor and employee #1 to cut the bottom of the beam to get the roof to collapse. Employee #1 made the pre-cuts (cutting the beam but not cutting all the way through the beam) and then he went to the ground in the aerial lift to get a choker and shackles to attach the lower piece of the beam to the arm of the hi-lo machine that was located on the south end of the building. Once elevated back to the beam that was pre-cut employee #1 attached the shackles and choker to the arm of the hi-lo machine and the cut beam. Employee #1 made the final cuts to the beam. Employee #1 started down in the aerial lift that was located on the north end of the building. Instead of booming to the left (away from the building) and then down employee #1 came straight down the west side of the building. Every other time employee #1 had boomed away from the building and then down according to the owner. As employee #1 reached approximately 80 ft above the ground the roof above the i-beam collapsed. The piece of the beam that was attached to the hi-lo arm swung out and hit employee #1 in the back of the neck area pushing him against the controls of the aerial lift. The owner of the company went to the lower controls of the aerial lift and lowered the basket to the ground. By the time the basket was on the ground the plant nurses and first responders were on site and started medical attention on employee #1.

On may 4 1987 employee #1 a crane operator was traveling with a load attached to the crane's main hoist line. The crane load consisted of ice 26-in. Swinging leads 72-ft-long and weighing 7 920 lb; construction form; a continuous flight auger 16 in. In diameter 59 ft long and weighing 3 127 lb; and a model 3040 4 500 lb auger drive for a total weight without the drilling attachment of 15 547 lb. The crane was traveling between the south side of a hospital and a riverbank over an area of fill 17.5 ft deep and consisting of brown silty clay with fragments of rock brick coal concrete and roots. As the crane moved from west to east a piece of concrete surfaced in front of its right track. The crane operator tried to move over or around the piece of concrete but the crane kicked back and the engine stalled in reverse configuration completely reversing all its mechanical power-transmission apparatus. As the crane attempted to maneuver around the piece of concrete the boom structure and load swung downhill toward the river embankment on employee #1's right side. After a failed attempt to swing the load back uphill toward the hospital he tried to lower it. The main hoist drum assembly foot brake was down and in a locked position but with the mechanical power-transmission apparatus in reverse the main hoist drum assembly rotated upward rather than downward. Employee #1 tried this maneuver several times until the crane load suddenly stopped because the assembly was in a locked position. This sudden stop created a dynamic (loading) to the crane and caused its uphill track to lift up. The crane overturned killing employee #1.,1

On june 23 2003 employee #1 a lineman and three coworkers were placing new 12 kilovolt conductors on utility poles in anaheim ca. The existing equipment which had 12 kilovolt circuits needed to be reconfigured to accommodate the new conductors. Employee #1 was in an international bucket truck with a versalift bucket assembly while one of his coworkers a fifth-stage apprentice worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner so the work involved moving the street side neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole pin position. The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice connector sitting atop the insulator so employee #1 pulled off this connector and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the apprentice coworker to climb down since this particular job was completed. The other coworkers a groundman and the foreman were also on the ground. Then for some reason the material handler load indicator contacted the energized phase and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body primarily his upper torso. Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed to be wearing rubber gloves but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this was true.,2

"At 8:30 a.m. on july 1 2010 employee #1 was operating a backhoe for the flatiron construction corp. The company was a heavy construction contractor specializing in paving. It was working on a new taxiway at los angeles international airport which had to be thick enough to support new jumbo jets. The finished surface was to be nineteen inches thick. As part of the preparation work an old asphalt-covered taxiway was being demolished. The area had been marked by ""dig alert"" to indicate buried electrical lines. There were electrical vaults in front of the tractor about twenty yards away to the right of the tractor about 3 yards away and behind the tractor about fifty yards away. The asphalt had been marked in red where the wires entered and exited the vaults and on the asphalt in front of the tractor. There was no marking however on the side of the vault to the operator's right to indicate any lines entering it. The job being performed at the time of the accident was ""potholing"" for soil samples to test for chemical contamination. Because the lines entering the nearby vault had not been marked the operator assumed there were no cables where he was digging. As he dug he contacted conductors energized at 34.5 kilovolts approximately twelve inches below the surface. He had been well trained and as a result he stayed in the cab of his tractor until emergency crews deenergized the conductors. This took approximately 3 hours. Employee #1 was not injured.",2
On february 18 2009 employee #1 a 21-year-old male with thedford construction company was working at a job site with a damaged connector probe.

Employee #1 found such a plug possibly choosing it because it was in an idle machine and the only one not in production. Employee #1 accidentally placed the ground prong into the energized plug receptacle and grounded out causing the third-phase fuse to blow. He was electrocuted. The wiring and the chicago pyle/national attachment plug were found to be very dilapidated and had not been inspected or maintained. Because of the configuration of the plug any of the eight-prong male plugs could have been inadvertently placed in any of the female receptacles energizing the metal casing. Because of employee #1's medical condition and the fact that there were no electrical burns inside or outside his body the coroner considered ruling the cause of death as natural causes/coronary disease. After continuity testing and destructive testing of the evidence the cause of death was ruled to be electrocution.,2

On june 25 2006 employee #1 was part of a crew that was removing antenna equipment from a 1 900-ft communication tower for placement on another tower. One of the workers was on the ground operating the hydraulic power systems inc. hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on the tower removing the equipment. Once it was free they would connect it to a 5/8-in. Nylon rope and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600 ft level of the tower where employee #1 was located. He was connected to and suspended by a 1/2 in. Wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him he would connect it to the hoist line and the hoist operator would then lower him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the equipment and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the course of the operations employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from approximately 1 800 ft as did a headache ball that was also attached to the rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop and the shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball. The nylon rope headache ball and equipment fell until they struck employee #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a cm chain repair link that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning system. The link separated and employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the hoisting system: the rigging hoist line and slings that were used to raise personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; employee #1 was on the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit; employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at approximately 500 ft on the tower.,7
At approximately 9:53 a.m. on september 24 2013 employee #1 a framing contractor was rigging a 520 lb 20 ft long laminated psl wood beam to a hoisting line on a tower crane at the worksite.

There were three coworkers standing below the rail lever bolting the transmission to a steel plate with the transmission being held suspended using an overhead crane. A hook was attached to the eyebolt to suspend the load using a steel plate with a hole in the middle. The eyebolt was passed through the hole in the plate and secured on the bottom using a nut and two washers. While the load was suspended inches in the air the eyebolt somehow broke into two pieces causing the wire rope cable to react through the opening creating a helicopter effect. The wire rope cable and/or broken eyebolt/hook struck the employee on the right upper cheekbone knocking him to the floor. Employee #1 was taken to county usc medical center by the paramedic where he later died; the cause of death was head trauma. Cal/osha determined the accident was caused by the mechanical fatigue of the brand new eyebolt used to connect the load to the crane. The forged steel eyebolt was rated with a work load limit of 4 000 lbs. And the weight of the transmission was determined to be about 600 lbs. At the most. The accident was caused by an unexpected mechanical failure.,7

At approximately 4:00 p.m. on april 6 2004 employee #1 a mobile crane operator was operating a crane at the control panel on the left side of the carrier. A coworker was assisting employee #1 in storing a jib. Employees were not trained in the work-related tasks. Employee #1 observed the coworker installing the jib stow pin upside down into the jib stow bracket-boom and told him to install it from the top. Employee #1 removed the two pins on the left side jib to boom tip then jogged the jib to seat it on the front jib stow bracket-boom. He then went to the front of the boom and installed the cable and anti-two block device on the boom tip sheave and reinstalled the load line retaining pins. He elevated the boom approximate 20 degrees and began to rewind the cable. The swing jib became displaced from the mounting brackets and fell.

At approximately 12:30 p.m. on may 15 2007 employee #1 was working at a site near spring road and route 94 in spring valley ca. Also at the site were a coworker who was a drill operator and a foreman. All three employees were employed by a commercial contractor that specializes in street and traffic light installations in southern california. Employee #1 was a locator who walked on the ground surface to locate the underground directional drill head using a detector unit to track the horizontal and angle movement of the drill head. This information was communicated back to the coworker who was the operator seated on the directional boring machine (a vermeer number d24x40 horizontal directional drill). The horizontal directional drill was used to dig under cement pavement and earth to lay electrical lines for street and traffic lights. The head of the drill first made a path through the soil underneath the ground until it arrived at its destination. A line was then pulled through it so electrical lines could be installed to hookup traffic and signal lights for public streets and freeways. The front section of the horizontal directional boring machine was outfitted with a left and right anchor boring unit with stakes. The stakes were large auger units that tapped into the ground vertically to stabilize the machine when its drilling rods apparently ran horizontally underneath the ground. The bolt holding the auger bit to the shaft on the main frame of the directional boring machine came off and the coworker had to take it apart to get to the dislodged bolt. Apparently the coworker tightened the bolt got up on the directional boring machine seated himself and unsuccessfully attempted to line up the square piece fitting of the shaft over the top of the auger attachment. Employee #1 came over and used his left hand to try and line up the shaft while the coworker manipulated the controls in an attempt to attach the shaft to the auger bit. The shaft dropped on employee's #1 left thumb causing the top one inch to be amputated. The foreman transported employee #1 to u.s. healthworks first and later transported him to the orthopedic center in la jolla. Employee #1 was hospitalized and required outpatient surgery the day after the accident. The division was notified about the accident on may 18 2007.

The boom fell on the redi-mix truck bounced off and struck employee #1 killing him instantly.",7
Employee #1 a carpenter for the general contractor was on his knees installing a guardrial on top of the screen-and-grit station (water treatment plant). At the same time the crane operator was positioning a bucket of concrete to pour the stairs. The bucket was too far out so the flagman signalled to the operator. The crane operator boomed up and moved the crane into position. The main boom cable snapped. The other employees heard the noise and ran for safety. Employee #1 apparently did not hear the cable break. He was struck and killed by the falling boom.,7
On june 22 2005 employee #1 a truck driver was a full-time employee working for a backhoe and dump truck construction contractor. He was leaning over the tongue of a trailer attached to a dump truck that was used to transport backhoes to and from jobsites. A skid loader similar to a bobcat had just been loaded into the bed of the dump truck and a backhoe with a circular compactor attached to the main arm was being used to close the tailgate on the dump truck. As employee #1 leaned over the tongue of the trailer retrieving some wood the compactor fell off the arm. The compactor which weighed about 600 pounds fell approximately four feet.

At approximately 3:00 p.m. on april 20 2011 employee #1 was working as a paving crew foreman at a parking lot construction job located on the campus of a local college. Employee #2 was working as the driver of a cat ap-1055d track asphalt paver and was working in the vicinity of a dump truck that was loading asphalt into the paver. There had been over 40 similar loads made that day all with the hitch arm assembly of the paver fully extended outward to allow the truck bed to get in a clear position for the dump. A spotter had also been present for all of these earlier loads and the job of this spotter was to assist the alignment of the paver and truck. On this particular dump the paver's operator was not aware that he had laterally retracted the left and right hitch arms at the front of the paver moving the arms inward while the dump truck carrying asphalt was backing up to offload asphalt into the paver's hopper. The spotter was also absent during this particular dump. The dump truck pulled in at an angle and the paver's left hitch arm was embedded between the outside and inside left rear tires on the rear axle of the dump truck. Employee #2 then drove the paver forward for about 15 feet before stopping with the hitch arm stuck in the rear tires. Employee #1 was called to the scene of the accident and tried to determine a way of disengaging the two vehicles. Employee #1 was standing between an adjacent roadway gate and within three feet of the vehicles. There was a blowout of the inside right tire of the dump truck. Employee #1 said he took one or two steps backward and was unconscious for a time where he landed on the opposite side of the gate rail. Employee #1 suffered initial bruising and concussive injuries to his ribs head neck and back and non-permanent facial dermal injuries from mixed flying debris from the tire blowout. He was hospitalized for over 24 hours at stanford hospital. The division did not issue an accident-related citation because no violation of title 8 of the california code of regulations was determined to have caused the accident. Operator error appeared to be a primary factor in the incident. However the operator had at least 3 years of experience in that position. Employer stated there had never been a prior instance of this particular sequence of events or results and has taken effective steps to ensure or limit the chance of such reoccurrence. The general contractor was not involved in any of the immediate events leading up to the incident and had no knowledge of it while it was in progress. General citations unrelated to the accident were issued to both employers for failure to document all required heat illness prevention procedures in writing.,8
On july 12 2012 employee #1 of bay cities paving & grading inc. was removing a pin from the sling used to lift/move a k-rail (modular concrete barrier jersey barrier used for traffic protection). A coworker the loader operator started backing up. The k-rail which still had the opposite side sling attached flipped over onto employee #1.

The employer did not have a rule requiring that such a barricade be erected.,8
At approximately 11:15 a.m. on may 21 2012 employee #1 a connector with concord iron works inc. was at a height that was approximately 15 ft above the ground receiving multiple lift loads of metal angles in threes from a mobile crane. While the load was being swung out and delivered by the crane to employee #1 to land and connect at the second level one of the angles (approximately 64 in. Long with a 5 in. By 5 in. Corner) started to slide out of its metal rope sling 3/8 choker. This angle then slid toward employee #1 who tried to fend this metal angle away so that he would not get hit. The angle weighing approximately 86 lbs nudged this employee off balance and he fell off the beam on which he was standing. He was able to grab on to the beam with his left arm and he hung on for a couple of seconds. Eventually however employee #1 could not hang on to the beam with only his left arm. Employee #1 fell down from that level about 10 to 14 feet facing downward towards his left side. When he landed on the ground employee #1 was able to turn around immediately in order for him to attempt to get up from the ground. A metal angle then fell hitting employee #1 on the head; he lost consciousness. He was hospitalized with unspecified fractures.,8

At approximately 10:30 a.m. on april 1 2013 an employee was working as a cabinet maker for a firm that manufactured and installed cabinets. The employee worked directly for the employer at the site. He was using a ripsaw to shorten pieces of lumber for the face frame of a cabinet. He was leaning against some moving lumber to help guide it through a self-feeding circular ripsaw. He was on the west side of the ripsaw leaning on the north side of the lumber that was against the fence where the stock was fed into the equipment. The equipment being used was a northtech model number nt-sl2000xl industrial ripsaw with serial number 0828003. Because the employee was leaning against the moving stock he did not observe a splinter on the lumber. The splinter punctured the inner side of his left thigh for approximately 2 inches (50 millimeters) injuring his femoral vein. He was in the hospital for three days. The incident was reported by the employer to the bakersfield district office at 3:12 p.m. that same day.,8
"On december 6 2006 a three-person crew consisting of employee #1 who was a lineman a foreman/groundsman and a traffic control flagman was removing communication lines and poles as part of a road-widening project in visalia ca. The main line ran east/west with the subject white pole (""p1/gas treated"") located at the west side of an intersection where it received a ""t-line"" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the ""t-line"". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject pole. The foreman supported the conductor with a rope for lowering while employee #1 who was elevated in a manbucket on the north side of the pole released the conductor/strand hanger. Just after the hanger was released the pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching point. The ""t-line"" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious. The foreman called emergency medical services and attempted to lower and move the aerial device which had become caught because of the lateral load. He then went to retrieve a digger with the capacity to lift the line but before he returned employee #1 had regained consciousness and cut the strand. This released the lateral force and caused the boom to rebound and eject employee #1 from the bucket. His personal fall arrest system prevented further injury. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted for cervical and lumbar spinal fractures. The subsequent investigation determined that the root cause of the accident was a hidden defect in the utility pole which was guyed and appeared to be structurally sound. Because employees were not required to climb the pole inspection and ""butt"" testing was not required. Inspection procedures would have required a visual appraisal in addition to driving nails and sounding of the pole at the first 2 feet above the ground. Employees demonstrated knowledge of safe procedures and of the hazards pertaining to wrecking operations. The employer had a well-devised and implemented safety and health program.",8
