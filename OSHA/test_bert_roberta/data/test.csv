On april 30 2012 employee #1 with walsh construction was placing bridge girders and beams while working on a temporary ramp leading to a bridge. Employee #1 was working from an aerial lift. Employee #1 was positioning the aerial lift and was pinned between the basket and a bridge steel beam. He was found unresponsive and died a week later.,0
At approximately 10:00 a.m. on december 11 2013 employee #1 a carpenter foreman employed by pacific peninsula group was performing interior carpentry at a residential construction site. He was using a bosch 4000 stand-mounted benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4 inches high his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were severely cut. Emergency services were called and the mountain view fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to stanford hospital where he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger which had been completely severed past the first knuckle near the palm was surgically reattached. The left ring finger which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle also was reattached but during a return hospital visit this finger required surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to cal/osha by the employer and also reported by the mountain view fire department. In its subsequent investigation cal/osha identified the employer as a construction management company performing as a general contractor for this residential apartment building project with tasks being performed by its own employees as well as subcontractors. The task employee #1 was performing required two rip cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished piece because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches high. Employee #1 was working alone and no witness to the event was identified. The guard for the bosch 4000 included a hood a splitter and an anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the site but employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other anti-kickback attachments separate from the guard/hood available to install. He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and guiding the wood through the blade with his right hand positioned at the end of the wood length nearest to him and his left hand positioned on the top and at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push block or push stick at the saw and he did not make one to use. He stated that the first cut was almost complete and the blade was about to come out at the back side of the wood piece when the wood kicked back and shot past his right side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade before the cut but was pulled back partially by the kick-back or his hand movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard anti-kickback and spreader features of the bosch 4000 were not separable. They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that the type of rip cut employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices such as featherboards were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been installed. No protective devices such as featherboards or anti-kickback attachments were available or installed on the table saw during the time when the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were available during the time when the table saw was being used.,0
"At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 18 2013 employee #1 an electrician employed by an electrical and other wiring installation company was working as a subcontractor installing electrical wires in the stage area of a building site. He was operating a scissor lift a skyjack sj111-3219 equipment no. 103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical wires. After positioning the lift he raised the lift's platform to reach the conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit he needed to move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand to move the lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to the right. However the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately released the controller and tried to move the platform down but it continued to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and an overhead pipe. Eventually employee #1 was able to bring the platform down. Emergency services were called and the san mateo fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three days. This event was reported to cal/osha by the san mateo fire department and the employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. respectively on july 18 2013. Cal/osha initiated its investigation at the work site at approximately 10:15 a.m. on july 30 2013. Participating in the inspection were employee #1's foreman/supervisor the project superintendent of the general contractor and the field operations manager of the general contractor. The investigation revealed that employee #1's employer had leased the scissor lift from sunstate equipment since october 16 2012. The employer returned the scissor lift to sunstate equipment on july 19 2013 the day after employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's possession the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering problem and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability to go up. Cal/osha did not issue an accident-related citation because the investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of title 8 california code of regulations (t8 ccr). However cal/osha issued one general citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the proper use of skyjack iii 3219 scissor lift in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions and section 3203 injury and illness prevention program a violation of t8 ccr section 3638(d).",0
On july 18 2007 employees #1 and #2 were assigned to weld the facade of a mezzanine.

On december 1 2010 employee #1 painted a four story condominium complex. The first floor of the complex was an open area designed for resident parking. Employee #1 operated a jlg model 600s serial number 0954270300042766 aerial lift. He worked from an elevated work platform. Employee #1 had his back to the building. He attempted to position the aerial lift to begin painting the window trim and either moved the aerial lift or boomed the mast out. As a result employee #1 became pinned between the building and the control station inside the elevated working platform. Employee #1 suffered severe injuries including contusions and abrasions. Other employees at the work site found employee #1 pinned between the edge of the garage and the controls of the aerial lift. Employee #1 was taken by helicopter to a local hospital.

At approximately 11:30 a.m. on april 27 2007 employee #1 was working from an aerial lift jlg model number 400s serial number 30079117 approximately 21 feet above ground welding steel bracing under the ceiling of a commercial building under construction. A coworker noticed that employee #1 seemed to be not moving and blue in the face. Employee #1 was lowered to the ground and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation started but was unsuccessful. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene apparently due to being caught between the aerial lift and a brace. The aerial lift was later tested and problems were identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering. There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and spring. Once the granular material was removed the control stick functioned properly and self centered.,0
On november 12 2002 six employees were spraying a fire retardant onto steel columns and beams at a jobsite. During this operation two machines were in use which required three persons each to operate it. On one of the machines one employee served as a foreman one sprayed the retardant and one dumped the material into the unisul spraying machine (employee #1). Employee #1 was in the process of dumping the fire retardant material into the hopper of the unisul machine when the machine jammed. He tried to correct the jam by pushing some of the material down towards the auger. His arm became caught by the tines which feeds material into the auger. An electrician noticed employee #1 yelling for help and immediately cut the electrical power to the machine. Emergency services were contacted and employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was hospitalized and treated for a puncture wound to his forearm. The machine did not have a point of contact guarded which would have kept any of his body parts from coming in contact with the augers in the hopper during the operation cycle.,0
At approximately 1:50 p.m. on july 31 2001 employee #1 was working alone in the personnel platform of an extensible and articulating boom lift that is an aerial lift. Employee #1 was killed when his neck was caught between the bottom of an outside flange of an overhead steel beam and the platform control console. An investigation revealed that the aerial lift was used in an area where there was a low overhead clearance and that the aerial lift turntable was driven in a position which was contrary to the manufacturer's instructions. It appeared that employee #1 drove the equipment with the boom positioned over the equipment front steering wheels instead of over the equipment rear axle and driving wheels causing the controls to propel the equipment in the opposite direction than intended.,0
At approximately 2:00 p.m. on december 21 1995 employee #1 was clearing brush from around a water settlement pond.

Employee #1 sustained a fracture to his right ankle and the coworker required first aid (not specified). Employee #1 was hospitalized.,1
On november 17 1999 employee #1 and another employee were installing a trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in. Bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the trough onto the supports and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the neighboring trough system while another employee tack welded the two troughs systems together. This procedure exposed employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As employee #1 stood upon the uneven trough a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly 20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However the fall of the far end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level) causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received surgical and postoperative treatment.,1
