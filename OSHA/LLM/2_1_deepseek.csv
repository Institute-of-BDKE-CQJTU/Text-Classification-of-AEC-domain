Employee Is Caught Between Lift Bucket And Beam And Killed,On april 30 2012 employee #1 with walsh construction was placing bridge girders and beams while working on a temporary ramp leading to a bridge. Employee #1 was working from an aerial lift. Employee #1 was positioning the aerial lift and was pinned between the basket and a bridge steel beam. He was found unresponsive and died a week later.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident occurred due to the first uncontrolled action of the aerial lift’s movement, which caused the employee to be pinned between the lift basket (a moving part of machinery) and the stationary beam. While the lift’s motion aligns with ""struck by moving objects,"" the decisive factor is the entrapment between two objects (lift basket and beam), which matches the definition and similar samples of ""caught in/between objects."" This category specifically addresses injuries from being compressed or crushed between objects, even when machinery movement initiates the event. The ""struck by moving objects"" category typically involves direct impacts from separate moving objects (e.g., cables, vehicles), not sustained compression between surfaces."
Foreman'S Finger Is Amputated When Unguarded Saw Kicks Back,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on december 11 2013 employee #1 a carpenter foreman employed by pacific peninsula group was performing interior carpentry at a residential construction site. He was using a bosch 4000 stand-mounted benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4 inches high his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were severely cut. Emergency services were called and the mountain view fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to stanford hospital where he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger which had been completely severed past the first knuckle near the palm was surgically reattached. The left ring finger which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle also was reattached but during a return hospital visit this finger required surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to cal/osha by the employer and also reported by the mountain view fire department. In its subsequent investigation cal/osha identified the employer as a construction management company performing as a general contractor for this residential apartment building project with tasks being performed by its own employees as well as subcontractors. The task employee #1 was performing required two rip cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished piece because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches high. Employee #1 was working alone and no witness to the event was identified. The guard for the bosch 4000 included a hood a splitter and an anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the site but employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other anti-kickback attachments separate from the guard/hood available to install. He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and guiding the wood through the blade with his right hand positioned at the end of the wood length nearest to him and his left hand positioned on the top and at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push block or push stick at the saw and he did not make one to use. He stated that the first cut was almost complete and the blade was about to come out at the back side of the wood piece when the wood kicked back and shot past his right side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade before the cut but was pulled back partially by the kick-back or his hand movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard anti-kickback and spreader features of the bosch 4000 were not separable. They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that the type of rip cut employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices such as featherboards were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been installed. No protective devices such as featherboards or anti-kickback attachments were available or installed on the table saw during the time when the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were available during the time when the table saw was being used.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the hand coming into direct contact with the saw blade during operation, which aligns with ""caught in/between objects"" as defined by entrapment in machinery/tool components. While the blade is a moving object, the injury mechanism (amputation via direct blade contact during cutting) matches the ""caught in/between"" category��s focus on machinery entanglement. The guard absence and lack of anti-kickback devices created a scenario where the worker��s hand was caught in the saw��s operational zone, consistent with the ""caught in/between"" samples involving unguarded blade contact."
Worker'S Face Is Crushed Between Scissor Lift And Pipe,"At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 18 2013 employee #1 an electrician employed by an electrical and other wiring installation company was working as a subcontractor installing electrical wires in the stage area of a building site. He was operating a scissor lift a skyjack sj111-3219 equipment no. 103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical wires. After positioning the lift he raised the lift's platform to reach the conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit he needed to move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand to move the lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to the right. However the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately released the controller and tried to move the platform down but it continued to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and an overhead pipe. Eventually employee #1 was able to bring the platform down. Emergency services were called and the san mateo fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three days. This event was reported to cal/osha by the san mateo fire department and the employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. respectively on july 18 2013. Cal/osha initiated its investigation at the work site at approximately 10:15 a.m. on july 30 2013. Participating in the inspection were employee #1's foreman/supervisor the project superintendent of the general contractor and the field operations manager of the general contractor. The investigation revealed that employee #1's employer had leased the scissor lift from sunstate equipment since october 16 2012. The employer returned the scissor lift to sunstate equipment on july 19 2013 the day after employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's possession the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering problem and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability to go up. Cal/osha did not issue an accident-related citation because the investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of title 8 california code of regulations (t8 ccr). However cal/osha issued one general citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the proper use of skyjack iii 3219 scissor lift in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions and section 3203 injury and illness prevention program a violation of t8 ccr section 3638(d).",caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident occurred when the scissor lift’s unintended upward movement caused the worker’s face to become entrapped between the lift’s guardrail and a stationary pipe. This aligns with the definition of ""caught in/between objects,"" which involves injury from compression between two objects. The critical first uncontrolled action was the lift’s unexpected rise due to the incorrect toggle switch setting, leading to entrapment. While the lift moved, the injury mechanism was not a direct strike by a moving object (e.g., a swinging boom) but compression between two surfaces (guardrail and pipe), consistent with the ""caught in/between"" category’s similar samples (e.g., workers pinned between machinery parts)."
Two Injured When Caught Between Boom Basket And Wall,On july 18 2007 employees #1 and #2 were assigned to weld the facade of a mezzanine. One of the workers raised the articulating boom basket too far and both employees' heads necks and shoulders became caught between the control pedestal of the lift and the face of the mezzanine. Employees #1 and #2 sustained injuries for which they were treated and released the same day.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the improper positioning of the articulating boom basket, which directly caused the workers to become trapped between the control pedestal and the mezzanine wall. While the boom��s motion initiated the event, the injury mechanism (entrapment between two objects) aligns with ""caught in/between objects,"" as seen in similar cases where equipment movement led to crushing injuries. ""Struck by moving objects"" typically involves direct impact from a moving object (e.g., swinging crane parts), not sustained compression between static surfaces caused by positional error."
Employee Hit While In Trench By Back Hoe.,Employee #1 suffered nonserious injury to his right knee when he placed his knee between a backhoe bucket and the wall of a deep trench. Employee #1 moved the bucket in towards himself and it pinched his knee against the dirt sidewall of the trench.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee intentionally moving the backhoe bucket toward himself, resulting in his knee being compressed between the bucket (a movable tool) and the trench wall. While the trench wall is a structural element, there is no evidence of structural failure or collapse (e.g., cave-in, wall disintegration). The injury stemmed directly from bodily entrapment between two objects, aligning with ""caught in/between objects"" definitions and its samples (e.g., workers pinned between machinery parts). ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event, which is absent here."
Employee Crushes Finger In Tunnel Boring Machine,At approximately 12:15 a.m. on june 29 2004 an employee who was a miner and laborer was working with a tunnel boring machine (tbm) segment erector. The employee noticed a shim out of position and reached in between the segments to reset the shim while the erector jacks were in motion resulting in his fingers getting caught between two concrete segments. The employee was hospitalized with a crushing injury to his right hand and later required hand surgery.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The injury occurred when the employee's fingers were compressed between two concrete segments due to the motion of the erector jacks. This aligns with ""caught in/between objects,"" which emphasizes entrapment or crushing between surfaces/objects (here, moving segments) rather than a direct impact from a detached or independently moving object. The first uncontrolled action was reaching into the machinery during operation, leading to static entrapment rather than a dynamic strike."
Employee Amputates Fingers In Tipping Dump Box Incident,The employee was clearing trash in a large dumpster. A forklift with a tipping dump box was being used to transport and unload trash into the dumpster. The employee released the locking lever of the tipping dump box. The tipping motion of the dump box caught the employee's fingers between the tipping box and the forklift. The employee's fingers were amputated.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The injury occurred when the employee’s fingers were physically trapped between the tipping dump box and the forklift during the dump box’s motion. This directly aligns with the ""caught in/between objects"" definition (compression between two objects causing amputation) and its similar samples (e.g., fingers caught between machinery parts or under lids). While the dump box moved, the critical factor is the entrapment mechanism, not a direct impact from a freely moving object. The first uncontrolled action was the tipping motion causing the pinch point, satisfying the ""first occurrence"" principle."
Employee Dies When Pinned Inside Aerial Lift Platform,On december 1 2010 employee #1 painted a four story condominium complex. The first floor of the complex was an open area designed for resident parking. Employee #1 operated a jlg model 600s serial number 0954270300042766 aerial lift. He worked from an elevated work platform. Employee #1 had his back to the building. He attempted to position the aerial lift to begin painting the window trim and either moved the aerial lift or boomed the mast out. As a result employee #1 became pinned between the building and the control station inside the elevated working platform. Employee #1 suffered severe injuries including contusions and abrasions. Other employees at the work site found employee #1 pinned between the edge of the garage and the controls of the aerial lift. Employee #1 was taken by helicopter to a local hospital. On december 14 2010 employee #1 died in the hospital from the injuries he sustained in this accident.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident occurred when the employee became pinned between the building and the control station of the aerial lift during its positioning. The first uncontrolled action was the entrapment between two objects (building and lift), consistent with ""caught in/between objects"" examples where structural elements or equipment parts immobilize the victim. While the lift’s movement initiated the event, the primary cause of injury was compression between stationary/machine parts, not a direct strike by a moving object in free motion."
Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Articulating Boom,On july 8 2009 employee #1 was pressure testing a new 10-in. Refrigeration line. He was crushed between the basket of the articulating boom and a new 2-in. Refrigeration line. He was killed.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The incident describes the victim being crushed **between** the boom basket and a refrigeration line, directly aligning with the ""caught in/between objects"" definition of entrapment between two objects. While the boom basket was moving, the fatal mechanism was compression (a ""caught"" scenario), not a singular impact from a freely moving object. The ""caught in/between"" samples similarly involve machinery parts (e.g., excavator arms, lift booms) trapping victims, whereas ""struck by moving objects"" samples emphasize direct strikes by detached/launched objects (e.g., pipe caps, cables). The first uncontrolled action here is the entrapment between the boom and line, not a strike."
Employee Is Asphyxiated While Working From Aerial Lift,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on april 27 2007 employee #1 was working from an aerial lift jlg model number 400s serial number 30079117 approximately 21 feet above ground welding steel bracing under the ceiling of a commercial building under construction. A coworker noticed that employee #1 seemed to be not moving and blue in the face. Employee #1 was lowered to the ground and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation started but was unsuccessful. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene apparently due to being caught between the aerial lift and a brace. The aerial lift was later tested and problems were identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering. There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and spring. Once the granular material was removed the control stick functioned properly and self centered.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The employee��s death directly resulted from being physically caught between the aerial lift and a brace, satisfying the ""caught in/between objects"" definition of injuries caused by entrapment between objects. While the control stick malfunction initiated the boom movement, the **primary cause** of the fatal injury was the entrapment itself. The ""others"" category applies to incidents not covered by other defined categories (e.g., mechanical failures without direct entrapment), but here, the explicit physical pinning aligns with ""caught in/between objects"" as seen in similar samples (e.g., workers pinned by machinery). The malfunction explains *how* the entrapment occurred but does not override the classification of the primary injury mechanism."
Employee Injured While Operating Unisul Spraying Machine,On november 12 2002 six employees were spraying a fire retardant onto steel columns and beams at a jobsite. During this operation two machines were in use which required three persons each to operate it. On one of the machines one employee served as a foreman one sprayed the retardant and one dumped the material into the unisul spraying machine (employee #1). Employee #1 was in the process of dumping the fire retardant material into the hopper of the unisul machine when the machine jammed. He tried to correct the jam by pushing some of the material down towards the auger. His arm became caught by the tines which feeds material into the auger. An electrician noticed employee #1 yelling for help and immediately cut the electrical power to the machine. Emergency services were contacted and employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was hospitalized and treated for a puncture wound to his forearm. The machine did not have a point of contact guarded which would have kept any of his body parts from coming in contact with the augers in the hopper during the operation cycle.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The injury occurred when the employee’s arm became entangled in the machine’s tines during an attempt to clear a jam. This aligns with ""caught in/between objects,"" which involves direct entrapment by machinery components (e.g., augers, tines), as seen in the category’s similar samples. While the tines were moving, the first uncontrolled action was the entrapment itself, not an external object striking the victim. ""Struck by moving objects"" typically involves impacts from detached or propelled objects (e.g., flying abrasive disks), which is inconsistent with this scenario."
Employee Killed When Caught Between Steel Beam And Console,At approximately 1:50 p.m. on july 31 2001 employee #1 was working alone in the personnel platform of an extensible and articulating boom lift that is an aerial lift. Employee #1 was killed when his neck was caught between the bottom of an outside flange of an overhead steel beam and the platform control console. An investigation revealed that the aerial lift was used in an area where there was a low overhead clearance and that the aerial lift turntable was driven in a position which was contrary to the manufacturer's instructions. It appeared that employee #1 drove the equipment with the boom positioned over the equipment front steering wheels instead of over the equipment rear axle and driving wheels causing the controls to propel the equipment in the opposite direction than intended.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident’s first uncontrolled action was the improper positioning of the aerial lift, which caused the employee’s neck to be trapped between the stationary steel beam and the console. While the lift’s movement contributed, the injury mechanism directly aligns with ""caught in/between objects"" (entrapment between two surfaces) rather than a dynamic impact from a moving object. The similar samples for ""caught in/between"" involve pinning between structures due to equipment misoperation, whereas ""struck by moving objects"" samples emphasize direct collisions with moving parts (e.g., swinging booms). Here, the victim was crushed by static objects due to positional failure, not struck by a freely moving component."
Employee Killed When Head Strikes Tractor'S Protective Cage,At approximately 2:00 p.m. on december 21 1995 employee #1 was clearing brush from around a water settlement pond. To stabilize himself he tied a rope around himself while a coworker held the other end. A tractor with a bush hog was mowing grass in the area. The loose end of the rope became wrapped around the bush hog. The rope was pulled from the coworker's grip and pulled employee #1 into the tractor's protective cage. Employee #1 died of head injuries.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the rope becoming entangled in the bush hog��s moving parts, which directly caused the employee to be pulled into the tractor��s cage. While the cage itself is part of moving machinery, the fatal injury mechanism involved being trapped between the rope��s force and the cage, consistent with ""caught in/between"" (entrapment by interacting forces). The ""struck by moving objects"" category implies direct impact from a projectile or freely moving object, whereas this scenario centers on entanglement and compression between objects."
Employee'S Body Is Caught In Asphalt Machine  Dies,On november 27 2012 employee #1 was operating an asphalt-pulverizing machine. The employee's work clothing zipper was caught in the asphalt-pulverizing machine pulling his body into the squeeze point action of the machine. Employee #1 was amputated from the abdominal point of his body. The employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident’s first uncontrolled action was the employee’s clothing becoming entangled in the machine’s moving parts, directly trapping him in a pinch point. This aligns with ""caught in/between objects"" (defined by entrapment between objects/machine components) rather than ""struck by moving objects"" (defined by impact from a projectile or independently moving object). The similarity to Category 2’s sample 2 (jeans caught on rotating core) reinforces this classification, as both involve dynamic entrapment by machinery, not a detached object striking the victim."
Employee Is Pinned Between Truck And Trailer  Dies,At approximately 7:00 a.m. on november 27 2912 employee #1 was delivering pipes for a water line installation. The employee was working alone and parked the trailer truck. Employee #1 unhooked the trailer from the truck and the trailer rolled forward. The employee was pinned between the truck and the trailer. A coworker realized the employee#1 had not returned and went to look for him. The coworker found employee #1 caught between the truck and trailer. Another coworker called emergency medical services and employee #1 was transported to a trauma unit where he was pronounced dead.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The accident occurred due to the employee being pinned between the truck and the trailer after the trailer rolled forward unintentionally. This aligns with the ""caught in/between objects"" definition, which emphasizes entrapment between objects (even if one is moving). The trailer’s motion created a pinch point, directly mirroring similar samples in this category (e.g., workers crushed between machinery or vehicles). While the trailer’s movement could suggest ""struck by moving objects,"" the critical factor is the entrapment scenario, not an independent moving object striking the victim. The first uncontrolled action was the trailer’s unintended forward motion, leading to the fatal pinning."
Employee'S Toe Injured By Falling Compactor,At approximately 8:10 a.m. on december 12 1991 employee #1 of santa maria electric inc. was operating a walk-behind sheep foot compactor. When he was lowering it into a trench that was about 3 ft wide by 2 ft deep the bumper fell down against the dirt bank catching employee #1's big toe between the bumper and the dirt bank. His toe suffered a chipped bone injury. Employee #1 was wearing regular work boots not hard toe shoes or any other foot protection.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the compactor��s bumper unexpectedly falling during operation, which created a pinch point between the bumper and the dirt bank. While ""collapse of object"" might superficially apply due to the ""falling"" descriptor, the bumper��s movement was a mechanical operation failure, not structural collapse (e.g., no trench instability or equipment structural failure occurred). The injury directly resulted from the worker��s toe being caught between two objects (bumper and dirt bank), aligning with the ""caught in/between objects"" definition. The ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural failures (e.g., trench cave-ins, equipment rollovers), whereas this incident reflects a localized equipment interaction hazard."
Employee'S Arm Is Amputated In Concrete Truck Mixer,On january 13 2005 employee #1 a concrete truck driver arrived at a job site to pour footing concrete into an on-site concrete pump. After realizing that the concrete was too muddy he climbed the ladder and added 50 pounds of lime to dry out the concrete mix. Employee #1 allowed the concrete mixer to run for approximately 15 minutes checked the concrete and again determined the concrete was too muddy. He climbed back up the ladder and added the contents of a 90-pound bag of cement into the upper hopper. While pouring cement the bag slipped out of his hand. When he quickly reached for it his right jacket arm became caught in the hopper causing his arm to be pulled in. Employee #1 was hospitalized for an arm amputation at the elbow.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The injury occurred when the employee’s arm became entangled in the hopper’s moving machinery, directly aligning with the ""caught in/between objects"" definition of body parts being trapped between components. The hopper’s motion caused entrapment, not an external object striking the victim. This matches the category’s focus on mechanical entrapment (e.g., fingers pinched by concrete lids or pipes) rather than impacts from freely moving objects. The first uncontrolled action was the arm being pulled into the hopper, consistent with ""caught in/between"" cases, not a projectile-like strike."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Collapsing Wall,On april 30 2008 employee #1 was using a sludge hammer to knock down a 9-ft high cinder block asbestos wall. He struck the wall near the bottom causing the wall to collapse on him. Employee #1 was killed. He did not use scaffolding to access the upper parts of the wall first.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The wall collapsed due to structural failure initiated by the worker’s action (striking the base), aligning with ""collapse of object"" definitions where structural integrity loss directly causes the accident. While the wall fell, the primary cause was the wall’s structural collapse (triggered by demolition), not an independent falling object. The similar ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural failures (e.g., unsupported archway, scaffold collapse), whereas ""struck by falling object"" samples involve detached objects (e.g., pipes, steel columns). Here, the wall itself structurally failed as a whole, making it distinct from an object merely falling from height."
One Employee Killed One Injured In Fall From Elevation,Employee #1 was on a column preparing to connect a beam. Employee #2 was positioning a man-lift to connect the other end of the beam to another column. The man-lift hit one of the supports holding the column and the column fell with employee #1 on it. Employee #1 was killed and employee #2 suffered a concussion but was not hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The column fell due to the man-lift hitting its support, which constitutes structural instability or failure of the support system. While the immediate trigger was an external force (man-lift impact), the collapse of the column itself��a structural component��initiated the accident sequence. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition (structural failure as the root cause) and its similar cases (e.g., columns collapsing due to wind or platforms tipping). The ""struck by falling object"" category applies to objects falling independently without structural failure (e.g., unsteady beams or tipped stacks), which is secondary here."
Employee Is Killed In Trench Cave,On january 22 2008 an employee working for christopher hauswald fell into a 3 ft wide 15 ft deep trench. Moments afterwards the trench caved in on him. The employee died at the scene. No other details were provided in the narrative.%09,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled or unintended action was the structural failure of the trench (cave-in), which directly caused the fatal entrapment. While the employee initially fell into the trench, the narrative does not attribute this fall to an uncontrolled slip, trip, or loss of balance (as in ""falls"" samples). Instead, the trench’s collapse (structural failure) is the initiating event leading to the fatality, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition and its similar cases."
Worker Standing On Raised Plywood Falls  Sustains Injuries,On march 8 2013 an employee of hanover builders was engaged in exterior carpentry work at a residential construction site. He was standing on a sheet of plywood on joists in order to spread a stack of plywood placed next to him. The employee fell approximately 11 feet. He was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for two fractured discs and fractured ribs. The employer was a framing contractor in business for 25 years. This work-related injury was reported to cal/osha on march 22 2013. The investigation determined that the joists did not brace and securely support the load that is the employee plus the stack of plywood.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The investigation explicitly attributes the accident to the joists�� structural failure to support the combined load (employee + plywood), which constitutes the first uncontrolled action. While the fall itself is a consequence, the initiating event aligns with ""collapse of object"" due to the structural failure of the joists. This matches the ""collapse of object"" samples where structural instability (e.g., unsecured joists, broken banding) directly triggered falls, unlike ""falls"" samples where the fall occurred without preceding structural collapse."
One Employees Is Injured When Boring Machine Overturns,On june 14 2012 employee #1 was working for payne mcginn and cummins inc. as operator of a boring machine. Employee # 1 was a member of a five man construction crew which included two employees employee #1 the boring operator and a laborer. Employee #1 was boring several feet under a petroleum line installing a new 20 in. Ductile iron pipe water line for the community they were working in. The excavation was about 15 feet deep 30 to 35 feet long and 12 to 15 feet wide. Employee #1 was positioned on a platform on the right side of a machine of a large horizontal mclaughlin boring 30-36 weighing approximately 5 900 pounds. Employee #1 finished boring 40 feet through the ground and was backing the machine up the machine rolled and lifted up off its 30 foot long track to the right crushing the operator while he was still at the controls. The laborer was in the excavation site he ran over to the operator when he saw the machine lifted up. The rear part of the machine caught the laborer's leg breaking it. The cause of the accident was the machine lifting off of the tracks and crushing the operator and injuring the laborer.,struck by moving objects,collapse of object,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the boring machine dynamically rolling/lifting off its track during operation, causing it to strike the operator and laborer. While the machine’s movement involved vertical displacement, it was not a free-falling object under gravity but rather a machine shifting position during motion. This aligns with ""struck by moving objects,"" which covers impacts from uncontrolled machine motion (e.g., rotating machinery parts or shifting equipment), as demonstrated in the category’s similar samples. The structural failure principle (""collapse of object"") does not apply here, and the machine’s motion itself—not a detached falling object—was the initiating event."
Employee Suffered Face Injury From A Broken Cable,On february 25 2002 a crane operator suffered a face injury when a cable broke. Emergency response was contacted but employee #1 was not taken to the hospital.,struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The cable breaking represents a mechanical failure (not structural collapse of a fixed object), causing the cable or associated component (e.g., crane boom) to fall freely. This aligns with the ""struck by falling object"" category, as seen in similar cases where snapped cables or detached parts strike workers. The accident’s initiating event was the cable’s failure, not a structural collapse (e.g., crane overturning or structural disintegration)."
Employee Injured When Crane Tipped,On april 23 2001 employee #1 was installing concrete traffic barriers on an interstate highway. Employee #1 was in the process of moving and setting k-rails and was operating a national crane model n-135. The k-rail was 20-ft long and weighed approximately 8 000 pounds. Employee #1 attempted to drag the k-rail closer to the crane and then attempted to lift it without the crane outriggers being fully deployed. This action resulted in overloading the crane and as a result the crane tipped. A portion of the truck-mounted crane's lighting system trapped employee #1 between the k-rail and the truck mounted crane. Employee #1 suffered a fracture pelvis lacerated bladder and trauma to the scrotum area. Employee #1 was hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the crane tipping due to improper deployment of outriggers, which constitutes a structural failure (overloading leading to loss of stability). This aligns with ""collapse of object"" definitions (e.g., crane tipping in sample 2 of that category). While the employee was ultimately trapped between objects, this was a secondary consequence of the initial structural failure. The ""first occurrence"" principle prioritizes the crane’s collapse as the root cause."
Employee Falls Through Floor  Fractures Wrist And Vertebra,At approximately 12:30 p.m. on june 12 2008 employee #1 was pouring concrete to make stairs on the side of the house being remodeled. Employee #1 walked across the second floor of the house through the framing of the wall and stepped on a plywood sheet that collapsed. Employee #1 said he went through the framing and stood on the plywood surface to see if the concrete vibrator was plugged into a spider box located at a lower level. The joists as well as other supports (concrete supports) were removed by the carpenters the morning of the accident due to the demolition project. The carpenters were going to renail the plywood onto new joists. The wood framing employee #1 walked through did not have any openings 18 in. Or wider so it was not a wall opening that required a guardrail. Employee #1 was never told about the unsupported surface. However the project manager of the general contractor said employee #1 was told about the hazard before the injury. Employee #1 fell 9 ft to the ground when the unsupported surface collapsed. Employee #1 suffered a fractured left wrist stretched tendons in his left hand and a fractured and compressed l1 vertebra. Employee #1 was hospitalized for five days.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident began with the collapse of the plywood sheet due to the intentional removal of structural supports (joists and concrete) during demolition, which created an unsupported surface. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition, as the failure originated from structural instability rather than a slip, trip, or unsecured temporary surface (which would fall under ""falls""). The first uncontrolled action was the structural collapse of the plywood, making ""collapse of object"" the correct classification."
Employee Is Injured In Aerial Lift Collapse,At approximately 10:45 a.m. on september 19 2009 employee #1 was operating an eagle 44 towable boom lift (serial number 17901) at an approximate height of 32 ft to remove signs located outside of a retail store. When the lower boom's hydraulic cylinder apparently failed the boom fell to the ground. Witnesses indicated that employee #1 was ejected from the basket and then restrained by his fall protection equipment. He was hospitalized at renown medical hospital for severe injuries to his face fractured ribs and a fractured vertebra.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident began with the structural failure of the hydraulic cylinder in the aerial lift, which directly caused the boom to collapse. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition (structural failure as the initiating event). While the employee was struck by the falling boom, the primary uncontrolled action was the structural collapse itself, not an external falling object unrelated to structural failure. The ""struck by falling object"" category typically involves objects falling independently (e.g., tools, materials), not components collapsing due to structural failure of the equipment being used."
Employee Drowned When Bobcat Flips And Pins Him Underwater,At approximately 8:37 a.m. on february 12 2003 an employee of watson trucking and equipment rental was operating a bobcat at a construction site. The employee was removing debris from the back of a house that was under construction. The employee was in shallow water operating the bobcat. He was observed moving the bobcat bucket in and out of the water. It appears that he was attempting to clean the bucket when the employee tried to back up out of the water. He was unsuccessful. When he tried to move the bobcat to the left the bobcat flipped over in the deepest part of the canal. The bobcat slid down the embankment coming to rest in approximately 48 ft of water. The employee was pinned under the machine and subsequently drowned.,others,collapse of object,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the Bobcat flipping due to unstable terrain, which directly led to the employee being pinned underwater. While the mechanism of being pinned resembles ""caught in/between objects,"" the fatal outcome (drowning) is explicitly classified under ""others."" The initial unintended action (flipping) triggered a chain of events culminating in drowning, which adheres to the principle of labeling the root consequence specified in ""others"" rather than the mechanical interaction."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Falling Joists,On october 14 2012 employee #1 and other workers were installing structural steel joists and decking to the top of cmu block walls. The joists were not yet welded into place due to heavy rain earlier in the day. When a bundle of decking was placed on top of the joists they began to roll and bend. A supervisor then had a crane move the bundle to a location where another bundle of decking had already been placed on top of the unsecured joists. When the second bundle of decking was lowered to the unsecured joists they rolled and fell onto employee #1. He was killed.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The incident originated from structural instability caused by unsecured joists that were not yet welded, which failed under the added load of decking bundles. This sequence of structural failure (unsecured components leading to rolling/bending) directly triggered the collapse, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition. While the joists fell and struck the employee, the root cause was structural instability during assembly, not a freely falling object detached from a structural system."
Employee Is Struck By Wooden Post  Bruises Shoulder,On december 7 2006 employee #1 was working in a 4 ft deep excavation installing a sewage pump. Approximately 3 ft from the edge of the excavation was a 4-in. By 4-in. By 8-ft wooden post (clothes line pole) imbedded in concrete. The soil was moist. The unsupported post fell into the excavation striking the employee in the left shoulder. He sustained a bruised shoulder. Employee #1 was transported to a hospital and released that same day.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The wooden post, embedded in concrete as a structural element, fell due to soil instability (moisture and lack of support), constituting a structural failure of its foundation. This aligns with ""collapse of object,"" which prioritizes root causes involving structural failure (e.g., trench collapses, bridge column dislodgment). While the worker was struck by the falling post, this is a secondary effect, making ""struck by falling object"" less applicable."
Employee Falls Due To Ladder Collapse,At approximately 11:15 a.m. on november 12 2012 employee #1 of young's roofing inc. fell from an extension ladder when it collapsed while he was installing a piece of flashing about 14 feet up on the building wall. Employee #2 was working nearby and both employee #1 and employee #2 said the ladder was resting on the building at a point about 15 feet above the sidewalk. According to both workers the bottom rails of the ladder were four to five feet away from the wall. Employee #1 said he was unable to find a tie-off point for his ladder. Employee #2 said he was setting upon a second ladder on the same wall. Employee #1 said he was transferring pressure of his right arm and torso onto the ladder while he was using a cordless power-driver to install screws for the flashing into the wall. Employee #1 felt that this is what dislodged the ladder from the bottom outward away from the wall. Employee #1 was taken to stanford hospital for treatment of injuries including two broken wrists and orbital skull fracture. He was released on november 15 2012.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident was initiated by the structural failure of the ladder (collapse) when it dislodged due to improper setup and pressure application, satisfying the ""collapse of object"" definition of ""cases started with structural failure."" While improper setup contributed to the collapse, the first uncontrolled action was the ladder’s structural instability leading to its collapse, not the fall itself. This aligns with ""collapse of object"" samples where ladder instability or detachment (e.g., removing bracing nails, unstable placement) directly caused structural failure, even if setup errors were a root cause. The ""falls"" category typically applies to slips or unstable access without structural failure as the triggering event."
Employee Killed In Fall When Scaffold Collapses In Wind,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on january 30 2008 employee #1 a stucco installer was on the top level of a 16 ft wide by 18 ft high tubular scaffold. It was positioned on the thirteenth floor roof level 146 ft 9-1/4 in. Above the ground. He was scoring the styrofoam base for the stucco when a high gust of wind caused the scaffold to collapse. Employee #1 fell approximately 140 ft to the third floor roof level. He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The scaffold was found to be improperly anchored.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The scaffold collapse originated from improper anchoring (structural failure), which directly initiated the sequence of events. While the wind contributed, the first uncontrolled action was the structural collapse, not the subsequent falling of the scaffold as an object. This aligns with ""collapse of object"" samples where scaffold failures due to anchoring/installation defects are classified under structural failure, even when external forces like wind exacerbate the collapse."
Employee Killed Due To Fall Down Air Draft System,An employee was working on a boom at a hospital over a 200-ft by 6-ft by 38-ft-deep air draft system. The boom started to break and the employee attempted to escape from the boom but fell into the air draft system striking the level below. He suffered bruises and contusions and was killed.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The boom breaking constitutes structural failure (""collapse of object"" definition), which directly initiated the accident sequence. While the fatal outcome resulted from the fall, the first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the boom (as seen in similar ""collapse of object"" samples like a broken boom or dislodged ladder). Falls caused by structural failure are classified under ""collapse of object"" per the principle of labeling the first unintended event."
Employee Killed In Fall When Bridge Form Collapses,Employee #1 was operating a bull float on a bridge deck when the form gave way and the bridge deck caved in. He fell head first and was buried up to his chest in soft concrete. It took approximately 15 minutes to rescue employee #1 from the concrete. He was transported to the local hospital where he was treated in intensive care for several days before he died.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The incident began with the structural failure of the bridge form (""the form gave way""), which directly caused the collapse of the deck and subsequent fall. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition (structural failure as the initiating event) and its similar samples. While the employee was buried by debris, the first uncontrolled action was the form’s structural collapse, not a pre-existing falling object."
Three Employees Injured In Fall When Hoist Cable Breaks,Employees #1 through #3 were working at a construction site. Employee #1 was working from a single-point suspension platform using a sky climber hoist cable model #480628 and a separate skylock cable model #305.006 serial #23our. His safety belt was attached to the skylock cable. Both cables were 5/6 in. Plowshare steel 1 by 31. Employee #1 was traveling from the 40th floor to the top of the building to install a counterweight when the hoist cable broke. The skylock failed to engage and the platform plummeted to the top of a lift car on the 31st floor. He sustained a broken leg and multiple contusions. Employees #2 and #3 were working on top of the temporary car installing conduit for the elevator operation controls. Employee #2 suffered a puncture wound and multiple contusions; employee #3 sustained a severely bruised shoulder and chest along with multiple contusions. All three were hospitalized. The top of the lift car had a guardrail and employees #2 and #3 were wearing safety belts attached to the car cables. They had no separate safety line.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from the structural failure of the hoist cable (a load-bearing component of the suspension system), which directly caused the platform to plummet. While ""others"" could apply to equipment failure, the cable��s role as a structural support aligns with ""collapse of object"" definitions (e.g., load block toppling in similar samples). The first uncontrolled action was the cable��s structural failure, preceding the fall and injuries, satisfying the principle of labeling the initial unintended structural breakdown."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Falling Ceiling,At approximately 3:45 p.m. on january 26 2012 a crew of five employees was working to demolish a storage closet measured approximately 9 ft. by 4 ft. by 12 ft. which is located on the third floor of a historic building. Employee # 1 and four other coworkers removed the plaster and the studs from the storage closet with the exception of two studs that remained attached to the retaining wall at the left side. Employee #1 and employee # 2 start prying the secondary ceiling from the original ceiling with one of the studs that was removed from the structure earlier. The secondary ceiling came down and swung across one of the wires that was attached between the two ceilings and struck employee # 1 crushing him between the wall/window and the ceiling portion that fell. The wall/window was located approximately 13 feet to the right from the storage closet.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The incident originated from structural failure during demolition activities. The secondary ceiling, which was part of the building��s structural system, detached due to intentional prying but still constituted a structural component being destabilized. The collapse of this ceiling (triggered by demolition forces interacting with structural elements) directly caused the fatal impact. While the ceiling fell freely, the root cause aligns with ""collapse of object"" as the hazard arose from the failure of a structural component during demolition. Similar ""collapse of object"" samples (e.g., walls/trusses failing during construction) prioritize structural integrity issues over the resultant ""struck by"" mechanism."
Machine Operator Is Injured While Removing Piles,On march 13 2013 employee #1 a heavy equipment operator employed by a large pipeline installation contractor was operating an abi vibrating hammer at a pipeline construction project. He was driving in piles and removing piles used to hold up shoring during a large excavation. As he removed one pile the chain broke and the pile fell. The pile landed on the edge of the abi machine injuring employee #1. He was transported to the hospital admitted and treated for multiple fractures and a concussion. He required hospitalization for four days. This event was reported to cal/osha on march 13 2013 by both the employer and the local fire department. The subsequent investigation revealed that employee #1 was an experienced abi vibrating hammer operator having worked for the employer in this capacity for 5.5 years.,struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The accident was initiated by the chain breaking (mechanical failure), causing the pile to fall freely. While the pile was part of a shoring system, the collapse was not due to structural failure of the pile or surrounding structure itself but rather an equipment malfunction. This aligns with ""struck by falling object"" (external force) rather than ""collapse of object"" (structural failure)."
Employee Killed In Fall From Work Platform,On november 20 2007 employee #1 was standing on a metal platform doing form work when the platform shifted and he fell approximately 13 ft 6 in. To the next level. Employee #1 died of injuries sustained in the fall.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The platform shifting constitutes a structural instability or failure (akin to a walkway or ladder section collapsing), which directly initiated the fall. While ""falls"" describes the consequence, the root cause lies in the structural failure of the platform, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition and its priority over secondary effects. The collapse category��s samples (e.g., walkway giving way, ladder dislodgment) mirror this scenario more closely than the ""falls"" samples, which involve slips/trips without structural failure."
Employee Killed When Struck By Falling Wall,On february 18 2008 employee #1 and coworkers were at a residential site erecting a framed wall. As they were working a high gust of wind blew over a previously-erected wall. Employee #1 was struck on the back of the head by the falling wall and was killed.,struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The wall fell due to an external force (high wind gust), not structural failure. While the wall was erected, the collapse was triggered by wind rather than inherent instability or structural defects (e.g., unsupported components, material failure).

""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event, which is absent here."
Employee Suffers Multiple Injuries In Fall From Roof Beam,At 11:56 a.m. on october 15 1993 employee #1 of anderson charnesby structural steel suffered multiple injuries to his head legs arms shoulder as well as several broken ribs when he fell off a roof beam made of skeleton steel that slipped during a welding and bolting job. Employee #1 stated that the beam was resting on steel columns on the roof of a building's penthouse structure and was hooked to a crane stationed on the ground. Employee #1 was sitting on the beam bolting the ends to the columns when one of the welds broke at one end causing the beam to slip and employee #1 to fall to the roof. He was thrown about 9 to 8 feet. Employee #1 stated that the beam was about 8 feet in the air.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the weld, which caused the beam to slip. This aligns with ""collapse of object"" (defined as accidents starting with structural failure). While the fall was the outcome, the initiating event was the weld breaking, a structural failure distinct from slip/trip scenarios in ""falls""."
Employee Is Struck By Glass Plate And Receives Fractures,At approximately 1 a.m. on march 21 2013 employee #1 was moving a rolling a-frame rack from a wall. A crew of two painters had placed the rack there as the suite that they were working on was being remodeled. The suite was located within in an office area of a high-rise building and was designed to have floor to ceiling glass panels that would separate the offices from the center of the suite. On the rolling glazier rack there were four sheets of glass with each of them having a dimension of 60 in. By 107 in. By 0.5 in. And weighing 284.5 pounds. Employee #1 grabbed the back of the rack and walked backward putting himself between the loaded rack and the wall but an extension cord on the floor prevented the rolling rack from moving forward and tipped the rack over. The glass panels struck the wall on one corner and then slid down trapping employee #1 in a sitting position between the loaded cart and the wall. One of the panels also struck employee #1 and caused him to sustain multiple broken ribs and a clavicle on his left side. The painters came to his rescue and lifted the glass panels off him. They then summoned emergency medical personnel. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center where he received treatment and was then hospitalized for one week. A month later he underwent surgery on his broken clavicle. The cause of the accident was a failure to instruct the laborer in the hazards associated with moving large glass panels.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from the tipping of the rolling rack (a structural instability), which directly initiated the sequence of events. While the glass panels struck the employee, their fall was a consequence of the rack collapsing due to an external obstruction (extension cord). Per the classification hierarchy, ""collapse of object"" supersedes ""struck by falling object"" when the collapse of an object (e.g., rack instability) is the root cause, even if triggered by an external factor. The rack��s failure to maintain structural stability aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition, as seen in similar samples involving tipped equipment (e.g., lift, glass sheets)."
Employee Is Killed When Crane Cable Fails And Releases Load,On october 5 2006 employee #1 a welder was working at a construction jobsite where a link-belt 218 lattice boom crawler crane was used to move a 10 000-lb mkt v22 vibratory hammer. During the handling operation the crane's gantry cable parted and the boom fell on a railroad car and a railroad bridge. The vibratory hammer was also released and it struck and pinned employee #1 to the ground. He sustained multiple body fractures and was killed as a result.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the crane��s gantry cable, which directly caused the boom to collapse. This mechanical failure (structural collapse) preceded and triggered the release of the vibratory hammer. While the hammer striking the victim aligns with ""struck by falling object,"" the root cause was the cable failure and boom collapse, which defines ""collapse of object"" as the initiating event. The similar ""collapse"" samples explicitly reference crane boom failures as structural collapses, reinforcing this classification."
Employee Killed In Crane Accident,On december 22 2003 employee #1 and coworkers were unloading concrete pilings weighing 53 000 lbs from truck/trailers using a crane. While unloading the second piling the crane tipped causing the main pendant lines that were supporting the boom to fail. The boom fell to the ground and struck employee #1 on the head. Employee #1 was pronounced dead.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated with the crane tipping due to pendant line failure, which constitutes equipment/system collapse (structural failure) analogous to ""crane overturning"" examples in the ""collapse of object"" category.

This aligns with the principle of labeling the initial structural failure rather than the secondary consequence (falling boom)."
Two Employees Killed  Four Injured By Collapsed Crane,At approximately 1:30 pm on march 25 2008 employee's #1 #2 #3 and #4 entered a two story structure for a meeting on a jump/climb. The meeting structure was beneath the crane. Parts of the crane which was supported by the monorail became dislodged and fell approximately 50 ft. striking an outrigger. The crane was then then thrown an additional 350 ft. crashing through the roof of the structure where employees #1 #2 #3 and #4 were meeting. The crane continued to fall through the first floor striking employee's #5 and #6. The crane sent employees #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 and #6 crashing through to the first floor burying them. Employee's #1 and #2 were fatally injured as a result of the accident. Employees #4 and #5 hospitalized and treated for their injuries. Employees # 3 and #6 were taken to the hospital treated and released.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident began with structural failure when ""parts of the crane which was supported by the monorail became dislodged,"" initiating uncontrolled collapse. This matches the ""collapse of object"" definition (structural failure as the root cause) and aligns with its similar samples involving crane/ladder collapses. While the crane components fell and struck workers, the primary trigger was structural instability of the monorail system, not a freely falling object unrelated to structural failure. The first unintended action was the structural dislodgment, not the subsequent falling motion."
Worker Incurs Arterial Tear From Scaffold Fall And Dies,On december 27 2012 employee #1 a 42-year-old drywall installer employed by grayhawk llc was working at a commercial building. He was working from a baker scaffold at an elevation of approximately 23 inches as he attempted to install wood sheathing (plywood) across a temporary exterior wall opening. Employee #1 did not have the scaffold's casters in the locked position. As he attempted to screw in the plywood he reached forward away from the scaffold. The scaffold began to roll out from underneath him. Employee #1 fell forward off the scaffold. His left thigh struck a structural upright member of the scaffold causing a large contusion and swelling. He finished his shift and commuted home. Later that evening employee #1 went to the hospital complaining of pain and swelling in his left leg. He was admitted and surgery was performed to correct bleeding and a tear in his left superficial femoral artery. Employee #1 remained hospitalized due to the formation of blood clots in his legs and lungs. On january 2 2013 employee #1 suffered a cardiac arrest likely due to the pulmonary clotting and died.,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The accident was triggered by the scaffold rolling due to unlocked casters, causing the worker to fall. While the scaffold’s structural upright member contributed to the injury, the initiating event was a slip/trip (uncontrolled movement of the scaffold), not structural failure.

Employee Sustains Fracture In Fall As A Wall Collapses,At about 8:00 a.m. on september 28 2013 employee #1 with cg scaffolding was installing guardrails on a bracket/stacker scaffold on an architectural wall in the front of a two-story house. As employee #1 was installing the last section of the guardrails the architectural wall gave way. Employee #1 fell with the wall 16 feet and six ins. On to a concrete floor. Employee #1 was hospitalized for five weeks with an unspecified fracture.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident sequence began with the architectural wall��s structural failure (""gave way""), which directly caused the fall.

Demolition Worker Is Injured When Roof Collapses,At approximately 7:05 a.m. on november 14 2013 employee #1 a 58-year-old male with csa constructors inc. was remodeling a commuter terminal at the american airlines eagles nest commuter terminal at los angeles international airport. The airline commuter terminal was still in operation at the time of the incident. This required construction of temporary walls to separate airline passengers from the construction activity. Employees #1 and a coworker were removing a temporary wall that had served this purpose. The top track of the temporary wall had been attached to the ceiling with double sided tape and they were removing the top track from the ceiling. The coworker was on a scissor lift using a crow bar to pry the top track off the ceiling and then he would hand the top track sections to employee #1 to stack them on the floor for later disposal. As the coworker was pried a section of top track from the ceiling a (20 ft by 22 ft) suspended lath and stucco ceiling dislodged from the roof decking where it had been secured with sheet metal screws and fell onto employee #1 knocking him to the ground and trapped him under the debris. The supervisor who was about 10 ft away when the roof collapsed went to help employee #1 and lifted the ceiling enough for him get out from under the ceiling debris. Employee #1 sustained a fractured little toe on his right foot and a left shoulder rotator tear he was treated and released from the emergency room and the coworker sustained a laceration to his left arm requiring sutures at a local industrial clinic.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the suspended ceiling dislodging from its secured attachment (sheet metal screws) to the roof decking. This structural collapse directly preceded the falling debris. While the ceiling fell onto the worker, the root cause was the failure of a fixed structural component, aligning with ""collapse of object"" definitions. ""Struck by falling object"" would apply only if the ceiling fell due to external forces (e.g., improper handling) without structural failure. The demolition activity (prying the track) triggered the structural failure, making ""collapse of object"" the initiating event."
Two Employees Are Injured After Falling To Basement,On january 8 2005 employee #1 and employee #2 were working for three d service a construction and demolition business partially demolishing a two story building plus basement. They were on the roof of the basement approximately 34 ft high torch cutting the end shoulder beams of a 12-ft by 20-ft section or the first floor. Some support joists 11 joists out of 13 underneath gave way making the roof of basement collapse. The two employees fell with roof about 12 feet to basement and were seriously injured. Employee #1 suffered a concussion and employee #2 suffered strains and sprains. Both employees were hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from structural failure (support joists giving way), which is the first uncontrolled action per the definition of ""collapse of object.""

Employee Fractures Hip In Fall From Storage Area,At approximately 1:20 p.m. on september 24 2004 employee #1 was assigned to replenish building materials in the warehouse. He was loading building insulation with a forklift. The material comes in wrapped plastic bundles approximately 4 ft 4 in. By 3 ft 7 in. By 24 in. And weighed approximately 90 lbs. The bundles are secured with five plastic straps and stacked three high on a pallet. The area employee #1 was loading was a loft approximately 12 ft 4 in. High. The procedure is to load the first pallet with the forklift then load the next pallet pushing with the forklift to make room. On this particular occasion employee #1 had loaded three or four pallets when one of the top bundles became misaligned. He got off the forklift climbed up a fixed ladder on the side of the shelf picked up the bundle by the plastic strapping and began to turn the bundle using the plastic straps. He felt the strap he was holding snap and was catapulted off the shelf. He first fell onto the forklift and then fell from there to the concrete floor breaking his hip. The foreman was first on the scene and found employee #1 conscious on the floor. Employee #1 told him that he had been trying to turn a bundle when a strap he was holding snapped and he fell. He also said he felt pain in his hip. The police was called and the employee was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The foreman investigated the bundles the employee had been loading and could not find a misaligned bundle nor any bundles on the shelf with broken straps. The forks were in a raised position and backed away approximately 2 ft from the last loaded bundle. The edge of this bundle was aligned with the edge of the shelf. The ladder the employee climbed to access the location was on the side of the forklift opposite to that where the employee was ultimately found. He was hospitalized with a fractured hip..,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee's fall from the 12-foot-high loft during manual handling, which directly caused the injury. While the snapped strap initiated the fall, the ""falls"" category explicitly covers falls from elevation not caused by structural failure. The ""others"" category applies to equipment/material failures not directly tied to falls (e.g., rope/pulley systems breaking during lifting), but here, the critical sequence is the fall itself as the primary accident mechanism.

Drill Rig Seat Breaks  Operator Falls  Dies From Concussion,At approximately 1:05 p.m. on june 5 2012 an employee of veit companies llc was working at the highway 169/i-494 interchange reconstruction project a project of the minnesota department of transportation. Veit a specialty construction contractor headquartered in rogers mn had been subcontracted by the general contractor highway technologies to conduct the hole-digging operations in preparation for pouring concrete for piers and pylons. According to the veit supervisor's incident report and also the company's incident investigation report the employee was operating a drill rig to dig 29-foot holes. He phoned maintenance fleet to inform them that he had broken the seat on the drill rig he was done at the site and he would be returning the rig to the maintenance fleet for repairs. Approximately 1 hour later the employee was found lying on the ground adjacent to the drill rig with the chair positioned under his right leg and behind his knee and his hard hat near his legs. The pedestal of the chair was broken in half. He was determined to have suffered a concussion. The employee died on june 18 2012 as a result of this head trauma injury. There were no witnesses to this accident. The general contractor was onsite but this project was large and no employees were in the accident area at the time of the accident.,others,collapse of object,错误,"The accident was initiated by a mechanical malfunction (seat breaking) rather than structural failure.

Employee Is Injured When Struck By Metal Rack,On july 29 2009 employee #1 and a coworker working on the platform of a jlg scissorlift model number 330crt serial number 200078542 were installing metal warehouse storage racks. For some reason the scissorlift would not lift up compelling another employee the foreman to use a forklift to assist the work platform. Once the forklift was pulled from the work platform the scissorlift platform fell approximately 6 ft to 7 ft to the ground causing the metal storage rack materials to bounce off the platform and strike employee #1 and his coworker. Employee #1 sustained a fracture to his right ankle and the coworker required first aid (not specified). Employee #1 was hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the scissorlift platform falling due to instability or structural failure after the forklift was removed. This collapse directly caused the storage racks to dislodge and strike the workers. While ""struck by falling object"" describes the mechanism of injury, the root cause was the platform collapse (structural failure of equipment), aligning with ""collapse of object"" samples where structural failures (e.g., roof trusses, joists) precipitated falling objects and injuries. The principle of labeling the initial unintended action (platform collapse) takes precedence over secondary consequences (falling racks)."
Employee Injured In Fall From Unsecured Trough,On november 17 1999 employee #1 and another employee were installing a trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in. Bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the trough onto the supports and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the neighboring trough system while another employee tack welded the two troughs systems together. This procedure exposed employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As employee #1 stood upon the uneven trough a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly 20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However the fall of the far end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level) causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received surgical and postoperative treatment.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the steel support (bolt loosening and partial trough collapse), which directly triggered the twisting motion that knocked the employee off. While the fall caused the injury, the accident originated from structural instability��a defining feature of ""collapse of object."" The ""falls"" category applies to slips/trips or falls not caused by structural failures, whereas here, the fall was a consequence of the initial structural collapse, aligning with the principle of labeling the first unintended action."
Employee Is Killed When Bulldozer Tips Over,On july 7 2011 employee # 1 was crushed by the front end loader he was operating when it rolled over on top of him. No other details were provided.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The bulldozer tipping over constitutes structural failure during operation (similar to crane/excavator collapses in the ""collapse of object"" samples), where loss of stability directly caused the fatality. While the bulldozer was a moving machine, the primary uncontrolled action was its collapse due to operational instability, not an external moving object striking the victim. The ""first occurrence"" principle prioritizes the structural failure over incidental motion."
Employees Are Injured While Building Bridge Formwork,On january 7 2004 employees #1 through #5 were on a crew building a rebar form to be used in a bridge column. The form was lying on its side and the employees were tying in a 94-ft-long piece of #18 rebar that was held up by manual winches attached to a 42-ft-long spreader bar on the forks of an ingersoll-rand vr1056 industrial truck (serial number 562101). When the site general foreman operating the industrial truck lowered the spreader bar to move it the rebar ties failed. The unsecured spreader bar then fell striking the five employees knocking them from the form to the ground. Employee #1 was hospitalized for multiple fractures. The other four employees suffered sprains contusions and concussions.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from structural failure of the formwork system. The rebar ties failed, causing the spreader bar (a structural component of the rigging system) to collapse. While the spreader bar struck the workers, the root cause was the structural instability of the formwork assembly, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition. This distinguishes it from ""struck by falling object,"" which applies to objects not part of a structural system (e.g., tools, loose materials). The similarity to ""collapse of object"" samples (e.g., rebar column collapses) reinforces this classification."
Employee Injured In Fall When Bridge Deck Fails,Employee #1 and a coworker both carpenters were landing a bunk of 4 by 4 by 20 timbers on a bridge construction job when the members on which they were being placed twisted and failed. The weight of the timbers broke the false deck below them and both workers fell approximately 22 ft to the ground. Employee #1 sustained injuries that required hospitalization.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The incident began with structural failure (members twisting and failing), which directly caused the false deck to collapse. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition and its samples, where structural failure precedes falls. The ""falls"" category applies to falls not rooted in structural collapse, but here the first uncontrolled action was the structural failure."
Employee'S Arm Fractured In Fall When Crane Overturns,"On december 26 2007 employee #1 was operating a p&h; lattice truck-mounted boom crane model #9150 serial #51529. He had completed work at a tilt-up panel commercial construction job in monrovia ca and was dismantling the crane for travel. Previously he had unmounted a rear counterweight and set it on a flatbed truck on one side of the site. This was necessary because the crane had become stuck in the mud that formed after several days of heavy rain. To remove the counterweight the crane had been jacked up and plywood placed under the wheels to free the crane. Employee #1 then moved the crane to the other side of the site to unload a spreader bar and associated rigging onto another flatbed. He did not set the outriggers before starting this job. Employee #1 then tried to ""get a better look"" at the position of the second flatbed truck which apparently had pulled up farther than he had anticipated. He started to swing the crane to the left and also to boom up on the tires when the crane began to tip. Employee #1 attempted to jump free of the crane as it was going over and suffered a fractured right arm. He was transported to huntington memorial hospital for treatment. Employee #1 later stated that he felt he had been in error because he should have set the outriggers before starting the task underway at the time of the accident.",collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The crane tipped over due to operational error (failure to set outriggers), which directly caused its structural instability and collapse. While the error was procedural, the primary initiating event was the crane��s collapse, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" category��s similar samples (e.g., cranes overturning due to improper setup or load mismanagement). The ""others"" category applies to incidents unrelated to structural failures (e.g., drowning, equipment rollovers without collapse), which does not fit here."
Employee Injured From Falling Piping,"On november 19 2000 employee #1 was carrying paneling when he heard someone shout ""headache "" then he was struck by several objects including screen wall tubing and scaffolding boards. The tubing fell about 13 stories (or 157 ft) and collided with stationary scaffolding. The collision impeded the force of the falling tubing (weighing approximately 200 pounds) and dislodged a portion of the scaffolding boards. The ricocheting objects knocked him to the ground striking his back and pinning his leg under a piping valve. Another employee who witnessed the accident ran to his location to provide him with aid. Emergency medical services were summoned and he was transported to the hospital. In the hospital he received treatment for injuries consisting of abrasions contusions and lacerations across his entire body.",struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The initiating event was tubing falling freely from 13 stories due to uncontrolled motion (not structural failure), which then collided with scaffolding and dislodged boards. While scaffolding boards were displaced, this was a secondary effect of the tubing’s fall. The primary cause aligns with ""struck by falling object"" (uncontrolled falling object), not structural collapse."
Employees Unhurt In 20 Ft Fall From Steel Cage,At about 8 a.m. on march 6 1990 employees #1 #2 and #3 were working on a steel cage made from rebar. The cage was the foundation for a concrete column for a bridge support. It was set into a cofferdam and supported by 3/8 in. Guys at each of four corners. One guy failed and employees #1 #2 and #3 fell approximately 20 ft to the bottom of the cofferdam. None of the employees was seriously injured.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from a structural failure (failure of the 3/8-inch guy wire supporting the steel cage), which aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition (""cases that started with structural failure""). The cage’s collapse was the first uncontrolled action, consistent with similar samples (e.g., rebar structure collapses due to defective guying). While the cage fell freely, the trigger was structural, not an external object detaching or striking workers. ""Struck by falling object"" typically involves objects not linked to structural system failures (e.g., rigging equipment breaking), whereas here, the collapse itself was the initiating event."
Employee Falls From Tower And Dies,At approximately 3:50 p.m. on march 7 2001 employee #1 a crew leader and three coworkers were replacing a 1.625 in. Coax cable on the top of a 400 ft wire guy tower. After climbing the tower employee #1 tied off to the electrical capstan hoist load line. In the process of riding the line down cable snap-ins were removed that secured the old cable to the side of the tower. On the ground the new cable was tied to the hoist line and employee #1 rode the hoist load line back up to the top of the tower where the new cable was temporarily secured. The old cable was tied in to the hoist line at the top of the tower and employee #1 got on the hoist load line and signaled the trainee hoist operator to lower the line. Employee #1 and old cable were lowered about 20 ft when the line stopped sliding around the drum of the capstan hoist. The trainee hoist operator was instructed to remove one of six wraps of rope from the drum. In attempting to remove a wrap the rope line came off the hoist drum and employee #1 and the old cable fell from near the top of the tower to the ground. Employee #1 died.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from a structural/mechanical failure (hoist drum rope detachment) that directly initiated the fall. While the fatal outcome involved a fall, the root cause aligns with ""collapse of object"" as defined by its focus on equipment/system failure (hoist malfunction) triggering the incident chain. The hoist system��s structural integrity failed (rope slipping off the drum), mirroring ""collapse of object"" samples where equipment breakdown (e.g., broken wire rope, pulley failure) precedes falls. ""Falls"" applies to slips/trips unrelated to structural failures, which is secondary here."
Driver Is Killed When Crushed By Pipe,At approximately 8:30 a.m. on june 22 2006 employee #1 a truck driver was helping another driver unload a 60 in. Section of concrete storm sewer pipe (that weighed approximately 12 000 lbs) from a flat bed trailer. A contract employee was operating a front-end loader with a fork attachment to move the pipe. The pipe section rolled off the forks and crushed employee #1 between the truck and the pipe. He was killed. This offloading procedure was routine and was performed frequently. There were no weather factors contributing to the accident. The company had a safety program.,struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The pipe rolled off the loader’s forks during routine handling, which is an uncontrolled movement of a free-falling object (not structural failure). The initiating event was the pipe dislodging from the equipment, not a collapse caused by structural instability. While the crushing force is severe, the primary cause aligns with ""struck by falling object"" as defined by objects falling due to handling errors, not structural collapse."
Employee Killed When Crushed By Land/Rockslide,Employee #1 and three coworkers were preparing a road bed for logging while working alongside a 10 to 15 ton granite boulder. A land/rockslide occurred crushing employee #1 to death.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The land/rockslide constitutes a structural failure of the terrain or slope stability, initiating the uncontrolled event. This aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition (cases starting with structural failure), such as the platform tipping or chain breaking in its samples.

Two Employees Injured In Fall From Unsecured Scaffold,At 10:34 a.m. on december 21 2007 employees #1 and #2 who had started work that day at 8:00 a.m. were on their first and second days respectively at the job site. They were assigned by the supervisor to fasten the gutter onto the roof edge. Employees #1 and #2 were working from a scaffold when it started to bend away from the building. Both workers fell off the scaffold landing on a concrete surface. Emergency services responded and transported both men to ucla westwood hospital. Employee #1 suffered a fractured right wrist and was hospitalized for two days. Employee #2 suffered fractures to his right heel and right hip and a back injury; he was hospitalized for five days. There were no witnesses to the accident. The scaffold had been erected a few months earlier by an independent scaffold contractor. About a month prior to the accident a coworker engaged in plastering work had cut two wire ties on the scaffold to apply the final color-coat of stucco.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The scaffold bending away from the building indicates structural instability (likely due to prior removal of wire ties), which qualifies as the first uncontrolled structural failure.

Falls without structural failure (e.g., slips) are secondary here."
Employee Is Injured In Trench Collapse,On february 2 2012 employee #1 was performing work in a trench with no shoring support. The trench collapsed and buried employee #1 to his neck. Employee #1 sustained multiple internal injuries. Employee #1 was transported to a local hospital and was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of his injuries.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The trench collapse originated from structural failure (unshored walls), making ""collapse of object"" the first uncontrolled action.

Employee'S Finger Is Crush By Falling Metal Catwalk,"At approximately 2:00 p.m. on august 12 2013 employee #1 and a crew were demolishing old structures in a flour packer section of a flourmill. Employee #1 tore apart an l-shape metal catwalk wherein one side of the shorter span of the ""l"" was attached to the longer span by 3 bolt and knots and the other side standing on two legs. He had already removed the three bolt and knots but the span was still in place/suspended maybe due to the long period of being attached. As he tried to grab a hammer under the catwalk the catwalk span suddenly came down crushing his right hand against the concrete floor. Employee #1 was transported to an urgent care clinic where he stayed overnight for observation then was transferred to a medical center where he was treated for his injuries and hospitalized. The incident resulted in the amputation of his right middle finger.",collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the catwalk after bolts were removed, which caused its unintended collapse. While the injury mechanism (""crushed between"") resembles ""caught in/between,"" the initiating event was the structural instability (removal of bolts leading to collapse), satisfying the ""collapse of object"" definition. The Top-3 ""collapse"" samples similarly involve structural failures (e.g., unsecured joists, ladder slippage), whereas ""caught in/between"" samples involve direct entanglement with tools/machinery during operation, not structural collapses."
Employee Suffers Skull Fractures From Structural Collapse Wi,At approximately 2:10 p.m. on may 22 2013 employee #1 of broken arrow communications was injured while working in a trench when a masonry block wall located parallel with and immediately adjacent to the trench became unstable and collapsed. As the wall fell away from the trench it landed on shrubbery and terrain preventing it from falling flat. The wall now laying at an angle to the ground slid into the trench pinning the head of employee #1 between the concrete footer of the fallen wall and the opposite side wall of the trench. Employees on scene used a back hoe to lift the wall off of employee #1 who was trapped and he collapsed into the trench. Employee #1 was able to crawl out of the trench on his own. Employee #2 a foreman called 911 and units from henderson nevada fire department and henderson police department were dispatched. On arrival fire units found employee #1 laying on the ground in the parking lot to the west of the accident scene. They stabilized employee #1 and transported him via ambulance to sunrise medical center where he underwent surgery to treat skull fractures and nerve damage to his face. Employee #1 was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit on may 22 2013 with a generally positive prognosis.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident was initiated by the structural failure of the masonry block wall (""became unstable and collapsed""), satisfying the ""collapse of object"" definition. While the wall slid into the trench afterward, this motion was a direct consequence of the collapse itself, not an independent moving object.

The ""struck by moving objects"" category requires the object to move independently (e.g., rolling dirt, displaced tools), not as a secondary effect of structural failure."
Employee Falls Off Roof And Fractures Arm,On september 23 2013 employee #1 a journeyman plumber was working for a plumbing company and providing services at a residential building. To unclog a drain he needed to access the roof of the building. Employee #1 used an extension ladder to go up to the roof of the one-story house. After completing his work he started descending the ladder when it slipped out. Employee #1 fell onto a concrete driveway below and fractured his left arm. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported him to a medical center where he received treatment and was then hospitalized.,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The accident was directly triggered by the ladder slipping due to improper securement, a slip/trip incident without structural failure. While the ladder’s movement caused the fall, this aligns with the ""falls"" category (e.g., descending a ladder that loses stability). The ""collapse of object"" category requires structural failure (e.g., a collapsing beam), which is absent here. The similar ""collapse of object"" samples involve objects destabilizing due to external forces (e.g., a dropped bracket), but here, the primary cause is the worker’s fall from height, not a structural collapse."
Employee Injured In Fall When Scaffold Overturns,On october 13 2006 employee #1 a foreman was working on the wall of a laboratory room at the university of california-davis. He moved a rolling scaffold into one corner of the room to reach the top of the wall. He positioned the scaffold with one wheel resting on a plywood cover that had been placed there by the primary contractor to cover a floor opening. After locking the wheels of the scaffold employee #1 ascended the scaffold and began to work on the wall. Upon completing the job he was starting to descend when he felt the scaffold begin to fall forward causing him to lose his balance. Employee #1 fell to the floor and suffered a fracture to the left side of his skull fractured ribs on his left side and a fracture to the end of his right thumb. Emergency medical personnel responded and employee #1 was transported to the university of david--sacramento where he was hospitalized for four days. Subsequent investigation determined that the plywood cover had shifted and the scaffold wheel had fallen into the hole it was covering.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident originated from the plywood cover shifting (a structural support failure for the scaffold), which directly caused the scaffold to overturn. While the immediate result was a fall, the root cause was the instability of the supporting structure (plywood cover), aligning with ""collapse of object"" as defined by structural failure initiating the accident chain. The scaffold��s collapse due to inadequate structural support parallels the ""collapse of object"" samples (e.g., disengaged casters, broken brackets), whereas ""falls"" samples describe slips or balance loss without structural triggers."
Employee Is Killed When Roof Section Collapes,At approximately 2:40 p.m. on february 26 2013 employee #1 was working with coworkers demolishing a building. A section of the building's roof collapsed and employee #1 was crushed. The employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The roof section's collapse during demolition constitutes structural failure inherent to the building being dismantled, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition (cases initiated by structural failure). While the roof fell and crushed the employee, the root cause was the structural collapse itself, not an unrelated falling object.

Employee Dies From Possible Electrocution,On september 2 2010 employee#1 a construction laborer and a coworker were installing a new water heater. It was determined that a new hot water line needed to be installed. Employee #1 went under the house while the coworker waited by the water heater. The coworker waited a while but noted no activity behind the wall. The coworker walked over to the entrance of the crawl space and found employee #1 lying face down on the ground. He called for help and pulled employee #1 out. Paramedics responded and called the coroner's office. It appeared that employee #1 had been electrocuted and was pronounced dead on the site.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The text explicitly states it ""appeared that employee #1 had been electrocuted,"" aligning with the electrocution category's definition of fatal injuries caused by electrical faults. While natural causes (e.g., cardiac arrest) could mimic electrocution symptoms, the narrative emphasizes the work context (installing a water heater, crawling under the house) and lacks evidence of preexisting medical conditions. The ""first occurrence of uncontrolled action"" was likely the electrocution during the task, as opposed to an independent natural event. The ""others"" category samples involve confirmed natural causes (e.g., heart attack, cancer), which contrasts with this scenario’s explicit reference to electrocution as the primary cause."
Electric Shock,A power line crew was installing all dielectric self-supporting fiber-optic cable onto structures supporting an existing 69-kilovolt overhead power line. As part of the project the crew reinforced the existing structures and installed the fiber-optic cable. To install the cable the crew would hang sheaves use a pulling rope to pull the cable through the sheaves and permanently attach the cable to the structure. The employees would reinforce the existing structures by replacing some poles installing additional cross braces below the power line and installing supporting braces above the crossarm. The employees worked with the power line energized some of the time and deenergized at other times. The employer relied on employee work practices to avoid violating the minimum approach distance when the line was energized. However because of the placement of the braces and fiber-optic cable maintaining the minimum approach distance was not possible on most structures. One of the employees was completing the task of clipping in the fiber-optic cable on a two-pole structure while the power line was energized. The employee was attaching the cable to the structure with a housing that included a rubber boot and reinforcing rods. As the employee was wrapping the rods around the cable one of the rods got stuck. When he jerked on the 1.8-meter-long rod to free it it passed too close to the power line and current arced to the rod. The employee was electrocuted and set on fire by the electric arc. His coworkers conducted pole-top rescue lowered him to the ground and administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Their efforts were to no avail as the injured employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the electric arc caused by violating the minimum approach distance to the energized power line, which directly resulted in electrocution. While the electric arc ignited flames, the fire was a secondary consequence of the initial electrical fault.

Employee Is Burned In Electrical Arc Flash,Employee #1 was installing an energy management device xedia technologies model number xps400 480 volt. The device was to be attached to a blank 100 amp breaking in the main breaker panel in the back of the store. Employee #1 and a factory representative installed the device to the 100 amp breaker. In the two slots above the 100 amp breaker was a 200 amp breaker and a 225 amp breaker. Employee #1 made the connections of the device to the 100 amp breaker and stepped to the right side of the panel to reenergize the breaker. He did not replace the breaker panel cover. When he moved the breaker switch to the on position an electrical flash occurred from the 200 and 225 amp breakers. Employee #1 received third degree flash burns to his left hand left arm face scalp neck and ears and was hospitalized.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The incident originated from an electrical fault (arc flash caused by reenergizing the breaker without proper safety measures), which directly aligns with the ""electrocution"" definition (""burns caused by electrical faults"").

Employee Burned By Arc Flash In Work On Electrical Cabinet,On september 21 2005 employee #1 of pacific data electric an electrical contractor was helping install a new 440-volt electrical power service for a machine in a spectacle grinding facility in los angeles ca. His supervisor who was not on site had assigned him several tasks. He was replacing a slide in a module in an electrical cabinet that contained two 220-volt buses when a nut fell causing him to jump and cross-phase the buses with a screwdriver. An arc blast occured and employee #1 suffered second-degree burns on his hands and forearms and first-degree burns on his face. He was hospitalized for two days. Employee #1 was not wearing protective gloves.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The injury resulted from an electrical fault (cross-phasing buses with a screwdriver) causing an arc flash, which directly aligns with the electrocution category’s definition of burns caused by electrical faults.

Employee Burned By Arc Flash In Repair Of Hvac Pump Switch,At approximately 1:40 p.m. on or about june 20 2006 employee #1 of northern kentucky electric service inc. was identifying and repairing switch problems on an hvac pump. The switch was a part of the 1 600-amp master control panel for an occupied commercial building. The line side was energized and the load side was off; the current was 480 volts phase-to-phase and 270 volts phase-to-ground. Employee #1 was using an uninsulated tool to tighten amps and receivers when an arc flash occurred. He sustained second- and third-degree burns to his face right hand and right arm for which he was hospitalized.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The arc flash originated from an electrical fault (using an uninsulated tool on energized equipment), which directly caused burns as defined under ""electrocution."" While the arc flash involved explosive energy release, the first uncontrolled action stemmed from the electrical system, aligning with similar electrocution samples where arc flashes from electrical faults caused burns. The ""fires and explosion"" category typically applies to non-electrical ignition sources (e.g., welding sparks, fuel), whereas here, the injury was a direct consequence of the electrical fault."
Employee Electrocuted While Painting Outdoor Sign,At approximately 12:30 p.m. on september 15 2006 employee #1 who worked a billboard painting company was on a catwalk situated directly above a 7 200-volt overhead power line. He was pulling on a painting spray hose so it would reach the work area when he struck the power line and was electrocuted. A coworker rushed to help him and emergency services was called. The fire department responded and transported employee #1 to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. He had been using proper fall protection equipment and had received basic safety training but nothing related to the hazards associated with overhead power lines. His employer had been in the trade for more than 10 years and should have been knowledgeable about the safety requirements for working around power lines but it had not scheduled any special provisions for this job site. The employer had apparently acknowledged the power lines once he was on the job site and positioned the truck at the opposite end but employee #1 who was in his third week with the company was directly over the line at the time of the accident.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was direct electrical contact with the overhead power line during hose manipulation, fulfilling the electrocution definition. While systemic safety failures exist, the classification prioritizes the initiating event (electrical strike) over contextual factors. The ""others"" category examples involve non-electrical medical events or mechanical failures unrelated to the core electrocution mechanism."
Employee Burned By Arc Flash From Electrical Box,On february 3 2006 employee #1 was trying to open the side doors on the main panel box in an equipment room to measure the voltage and amerage readings. The 480-volt 400-amp breaker was energized. He was using an uninsulated screwdriver that he had borrowed from the building's engineer and his bare hands to remove the plastic plate screwed into the panel when an arc blast occurred. Employee #1 suffered first- second- and third-degree burns to his face arm and hand. He was transported to johns hopkins bayview medical system burn center for treatment.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The incident originated from an electrical fault (arc blast caused by an energized 480-volt panel), which directly aligns with the ""electrocution"" category's definition of burns caused by electrical faults. Although the arc blast has explosive characteristics, the burns resulted from the electrical energy itself, not secondary fires or explosions unrelated to electrical faults. The ""fires and explosion"" category explicitly excludes electrical burns, and its samples primarily involve non-electrical ignition sources (e.g., torches, welding sparks). The first uncontrolled action was the employee interacting with live electrical components using an uninsulated tool, making electrocution the correct classification."
Electric Shock,An employee was at the top of a building bringing out electrical lines to be used for the day. As he was pulling a grounding-type plug from a spider box the prongs came apart. The employee apparently contacted energized parts of the plug and received an electric shock. He was knocked backwards and began vomiting. Emergency medical services transported him to a hospital for treatment.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action is the electric shock caused by contacting energized parts of the plug, which directly aligns with the electrocution category's definition. While the prongs separating initiated the hazard, the primary injury mechanism (electric shock) is explicitly covered under electrocution, not equipment malfunction (others)."
Employee Is Injured By Electrical Shock,On february 23 2011 employee # 1 was working for his employer an electrical installation contractor. Employee # 1 was instructed to hook up a standby generator to back up the electric power into a square d distribution panel. Employee #1 proceeded to hook up the generator while the square d distribution panel was energized. Employee # 1 pulled the conductors into the panel and a conductor came in contact with the energized buss bar causing a flash arc. Employee # 1 suffered an electrical burn. The employee was not wearing insulating gloves. Employee # 1 was transported to san joaquin hospital. The accident was reported to cal-osha by the employer on february 23 2011.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The injury resulted from direct electrical contact (conductor touching an energized bus bar) causing an electrical burn, which aligns with the electrocution category's definition of injuries caused by electrical faults. While a flash arc occurred, it originated from the uncontrolled electrical contact, making electrocution the first unintended action. The fires and explosion category typically involves combustion or explosions unrelated to direct electrical faults (e.g., fuel ignition), which is not the case here."
Electric Shock,A local utility company hired an electrical contractor to install new streetlighting at the corner of a hazardous intersection. The job required installing one of the streetlights parallel to an existing 13.2-kilovolt (phase-to-phase) overhead power line. The ground worker installed the streetlighting hardware and supply cable on the pole placed a synthetic nylon sling with a choker hitch around the pole and attached the sling to the load line of a derrick truck. When the derrick lifted the pole to an upright position the derrick's tilt-pole plumber arms grasped the shaft of the pole. The operator of the derrick truck swung the load around and began to set the pole in a 1.8-meter-deep hole. The ground worker was securing the cargo straps to the pole trailer as the derrick operator was setting the pole. When the butt end of the pole contacted the bottom of the hole the pole spun the streetlight into the overhead line. The ground worker ran to the pole to try to prevent it from contacting the overhead line. He was electrocuted when he touched the supply cable on the pole. He had entry and exit wounds on his right hand and right heel.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled or unintended action in the sequence of events was the pole contacting the overhead power line, which directly caused the supply cable to become energized. While the pole’s movement contributed to the hazard, the fatal injury stemmed from the worker’s direct contact with the energized cable (electrocution). The ""struck by moving objects"" category would require physical impact from the pole itself, but the harm here was caused by electrical energy, aligning with the electrocution definition and its similar cases where contact with energized lines during pole handling resulted in fatal shocks."
Employee Injured By Flash Burns When Pump Arced Over,At 11:00 a.m. on may 30 2003 employee #1 received flash burns on the face and left arm. Employee #1 worked for a fire suppression system contractor. Employee #1 a supervisor was in the process of finishing up work on the fire suppression pump and standpipe system. The test was an annual flow test. The system is rather large as it services a large warehouse complex for a food supplier concern. The test had been completed and the system was about to be restored to normal status. According to witness statements one phase of a 480-volt three-phase panel main servicing the pump arced over producing a flash and an accompanying fire. According to employee #1 and to witnesses it is believed that a lug securing the middle leg in the three-wire assembly coming into the panel was loose and that this coupled with repeated wear caused a gap in the connection resulting in the arc and flash over. Employee #1 sustained second and third-degree burns to the face and was hospitalized.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The arc flash originated from a loose electrical connection in a 480V panel, constituting an electrical fault. While the incident involved thermal burns and a fire, the first uncontrolled action was the arcing caused by the electrical system failure. This aligns with the electrocution category’s definition (""burns caused by electrical faults"") and its similar samples involving arc flashes from live electrical work. The fire here was a secondary consequence of the primary electrical failure, making electrocution the correct classification under the ""first occurrence"" principle."
Employee Injured By Electric Shock From Contact With Busbar,At approximately 9:15 a.m. on july 19 2004 employee #1 an electrician's helper was helping to rewire an old high-rise office building in los angeles ca. He applied fire stop to the electrical conduits in the walls on the first floor. The conduits brought wires up from the basement where high-voltage power lines entered the building and reduced the voltage to 120/240 volts. Employee #1 then remembered a 1 1/2 in. Conduit inside one of the service cabinets which was on the ground floor. The conduit needed a strap installed before more power lines could be brought up from the basement. Employee #1 removed two corner screws in the cabinet's door so he could open it and he was leaning forward over the splash apron to access the conduit when his head contacted a 120-volt busbar. He received an electric shock and was rendered unconscious. A coworker started cpr and revived him. Employee #1 sustained small burns on the bottom of his right arm and left thumb which provided paths for the electricity and a severe burn on the right front part of his skull. All the service cabinets on the first floor were de-energized except for one that was backfed to supply 120 volts for lighting the building. The cabinet employee #1 opened had a lockout on the breaker that was accessible from outside the cabinet however when he removed the corner screws the lock stayed on the breaker as the door opened. The busbars inside the cabinet were also backfed and had the breaker been closed an explosion would have occurred in the basement.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The injury occurred due to direct electric shock from contact with an energized busbar, which aligns with the ""electrocution"" category's definition of injuries caused by electrical faults. Although a latent explosion hazard existed, the first uncontrolled action was the electric shock itself, and no actual explosion or fire occurred to cause harm. The samples for ""electrocution"" consistently involve direct electrical contact as the primary cause, while ""fires and explosion"" samples require an active ignition event, which was absent here."
Electrical Repair Worker Is Shocked And Burned By Arc Flash,At approximately 1:15 p.m. on july 16 2012 an employee of solex contracting inc. an electrical contractor was replacing a power breaker cover after checking for proper wiring and power to the cell side. As he proceeded to put the panel cover back on an electric arc flash occurred. The employee suffered severe first and second degree burns to his left arm left hand and right hand. The long beach fire department which responded to this incident reported it to cal/osha's torrance district office at 16:59 p.m. on july 16 2012. The employer reported the incident to the torrance district office at 10:00 a.m. on july 17 2012.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The injury originated from an electrical fault (arc flash during work on a live breaker), directly aligning with the ""electrocution"" definition (""burns caused by electrical faults"").

The ""fires and explosion"" category applies to injuries caused by flames/explosions unrelated to direct electrical faults (e.g., welding sparks igniting clothing), whereas here, the arc flash itself is an electrical failure mechanism. The electrocution samples (e.g., arc flash burns from live panels) match this scenario more precisely than the ""fires and explosion"" samples."
Electric Shock,A three-person crew was tying a deenergized overhead power line to insulators on a crossarm on a utility pole. An energized 69-kilovolt overhead power line was also carried on this pole. Two of the employees were belted off at a height such that the crossarm was at waist level. One of them the foreman on the job started to remove a 4- or 5-foot section of armor rod from a hand line. As he was removing the armor rod he raised it into contact with the energized power line and received an electric shock. The employees on the pole were not using electrical protective equipment nor were the energized lines protected from contact. The injured employee (who was hospitalized for his injuries) had about 1 year of experience at the time of the accident. The other two employees had 6 months and 3 months experience.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the worker raising the armor rod into contact with the energized line, directly causing electric shock. While procedural violations (lack of protective equipment) contributed, the injury mechanism aligns with ""electrocution"" as defined by direct electrical contact. Similar electrocution samples confirm this classification, as they involve unintended contact with energized lines causing shock, distinct from ""others"" cases (e.g., falls or suffocation)."
Employee Electrocuted When Boom Strikes Power Line,On november 7 2003 employee #1 a laborer with c.a.c. Industries inc. was operating a pile driver. The pile driver's boom was picking up a headache ball on the sidewalk when a cable apparently contacted a 7 620 volt overhead power line. Employee #1 was electrocuted and two coworkers were injured.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the cable contacting the power line, directly causing electrocution. While the boom's motion initiated the event, the defining cause (per similar samples) is the electrical fault from the contact, aligning with ""electrocution"" as the primary classification when equipment-triggered power line contact results in fatal shock."
Employee Falls From Ladder After Electric Shock,"At 2:30 p.m. on october 10 2011 employee #1 was installing recessed lighting on the second floor of a building. A supervisor reportedly deenergized the power to a 277 volt line hanging from the ceiling. Employee #1 positioned a 10 ft ladder to access the installation area. He climbed the ladder and used a one-week-old milwaukee electrical proximity tester to test the insulated covered wire. Employee #1 did not get a reading from the tester. While holding the cable coming from a ""j"" box in his left hand he pulled off the scrap sheath with his right hand. Employee #1 contacted an energized 277 volt wire fell from the ladder and landed on his back and head. After evaluation at med stop urgent care employee #1 was hospitalized at sierra vista hospital for unspecified fracture(s).",electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was contacting the energized 277-volt wire, which directly caused the electrocution.

Electric Shock,A three-worker crew was installing a heating and air conditioning duct system in a battery charging room. The duct work was located about 6 feet 9 inches above the floor. The lead worker remained at ground level while the other two employees were working from a scaffold performing the installation. Three duct sections had been installed and the two employees began installing the third which had to be positioned above a cable tray containing energized but insulated electric conductors. A piece of 0.75-inch-thick plywood that was 16 inches wide had been laid across the 30-inch wide cable tray to support the 40-inch-by-20.5-inch-by-22.5-inch duct section. The body of the duct was 16 inches wide where it was to be supported between ceiling hangers that were also 16 inches wide. One of the two employees remained on the scaffold while his coworker walked onto the cable tray. The two employees then maneuvered the duct to fit between the hangers. The duct fell off the plywood cutting the insulation on a 120-volt conductor. This energized the duct section which was wedged between the metal side of the cable tray and a piece of metal conduit attached to the concrete wall. The employee on the cable tray was sitting or squatting on the side rail of the tray with the duct in his lap grasping the duct angle iron flange with his hands. This employee was electrocuted. The employee on the scaffold received an electric shock when he touched the duct (though for some reason he was not listed on the osha 170 form as being injured). He was able to release the duct and climb down from the scaffold. The plant maintenance electricians measured 120 volts between the duct and ground before retrieving the dead employee.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"While the duct falling initiated the accident chain, the direct cause of injury and fatality was electrocution due to contact with the energized duct. The root cause aligns with ""electrocution"" as the fatal harm resulted from exposure to live electrical current, not physical impact from the falling duct.

The electrocution samples emphasize direct electrical contact (e.g., cutting energized cables), mirroring this incident."
Worker Burned By Acidic Cooling Tower Additive,On August 18 2020 Employee #1 at a power plant was handling a liquid corrosion inhibitor with acidic properties used in a cooling tower. While disconnecting the supply line a coupling failed and the chemical splashed onto his left leg. He sustained second-degree burns and was hospitalized for four days.,exposure to chemical substances,exposure to chemical substances,正确,"The coupling failure caused uncontrolled release of the acidic corrosion inhibitor, making chemical exposure the first unintended action. While the pressurized stream propelled the chemical, the injury stemmed from its corrosive properties (second-degree burns), aligning with the ""exposure to chemical substances"" definition and its similar samples (e.g., alkaline solution leaks, hydrofluoric acid fumes). ""Struck by moving objects"" typically involves physical trauma from solid/forceful projectiles (e.g., valve caps, abrasive disks), not chemical burns from hazardous substances."
Three Employees Overcome By Carbon Monoxide,On august 31 2007 employees #1 through #3 were part of a crew of ten that was pouring concrete and finishing the floor for a new trader joe's store. The three workers were using gasoline-powered equipment when they were overcome by carbon monoxide fumes. Employees #1 through #3 were treated by a medic at the site and then sent to the hospital for additional treatment. None of the workers required hospitalization.,exposure to chemical substances,exposure to chemical substances,正确,"The workers were directly exposed to carbon monoxide, a toxic chemical substance, which aligns with the ""exposure to chemical substances"" category definition. While the exposure originated from gasoline-powered equipment rather than direct handling, the critical factor is the uncontrolled release of a toxic gas.

Employee Is Exposed To H2s  Dies From Possible Heart Attack,On august 11 2010 employee #1 a newly hired day laborer and employee #2 another day laborer of rocky plumbing were working in the excavation located at the intersection of clifford road and steel road in alvin texas. Employee #1 went for some water. When he returned he found employee #2 slumped over in the excavation. Employee # 1 along with the job foreman pulled employee #2 out of the excavation and emergency services were called. Employee #2 was transported to clear lake regional medical center where he later died. During interviews with employee #1 stated that there was no atmospheric testing or continuous monitoring while they were inside the excavation. The employer admitted that he did not conduct any testing of the area. He usually had an independent contractor conduct the testing for him but apparently that had not been done at this site. The employees had not received any training in excavation work or hazardous atmospheres. The employer does not have any safety programs in place for his company. Csho went to the site and collected air samples from the man hole that was put in by the employer and found that it did contain some h2s and an elevated lel. The medical examiner's office ruled that employee #1 died from atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease. The harris county medical examiner's office did not test for h2s.,exposure to chemical substances,exposure to chemical substances,正确,"While the medical examiner attributed the death to cardiovascular disease, the root cause of the incident lies in the uncontrolled exposure to H2S due to the employer��s failure to conduct atmospheric testing, monitor the environment, or provide training. The presence of H2S in the excavation and the absence of safety protocols directly created a hazardous condition that contributed to the fatal event. This aligns with the ""exposure to chemical substances"" definition, which prioritizes uncontrolled chemical hazards as the primary cause, even if secondary medical factors (e.g., pre-existing conditions) are listed as the immediate cause of death. The lack of testing and mitigation for H2S constitutes the initiating hazard, similar to Category 2 samples where toxic exposure (e.g., hydrogen sulfide) triggered fatalities despite other complicating factors."
Employee Injured From Exposure To Ammonia Vapors,At approximately 4:45 p.m. on january 9 2008 employee #1 and coworkers were engaged in insulation work on a large anhydrous ammonia tank. The tank had been nearly emptied before work was allowed to begin.

Employee #1 Suffers Heat Exhaustion Repairing HVAC Unit,At approximately 3:30 p.m. on August 19 2019 Employee #1 was troubleshooting an inoperative air conditioning system on a commercial roof. Ambient temperatures exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Employee #1 collapsed from heat exhaustion and was transported by ambulance to the hospital for IV fluid therapy.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The text explicitly states the employee collapsed due to heat exhaustion caused by ambient temperatures exceeding 100°F while working on a roof. This directly aligns with the ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" definition, which includes heat-related injuries like heat exhaustion. The similar samples for this category (e.g., workers collapsing from heat in high-temperature environments) reinforce this classification. While ""others"" includes medical events unrelated to environmental factors (e.g., cardiac arrest), the collapse here is unambiguously tied to the uncontrolled environmental heat exposure as the first unintended action, satisfying the principle of labeling the first occurrence.

Employee Frostbitten During Liquid Nitrogen Transfer,At approximately 4:00 a.m. on February 2 2022 Employee #1 was transferring liquid nitrogen in a cryogenic storage facility. A pressure buildup caused a vent line to release subzero vapor onto Employee #1’s left foot. He sustained frostbite on several toes and was hospitalized for specialized treatment.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The injury (frostbite) resulted directly from contact with subzero vapor released due to a pressure buildup. While liquid nitrogen is a chemical, the harm mechanism here is extreme cold, not chemical toxicity/corrosiveness. The ""first occurrence of uncontrolled action"" was the vent line releasing subzero vapor, which aligns with temperature exposure examples like freezer frostbite or hypothermia from environmental cold. Chemical exposure samples focus on toxic/asphyxiating effects (e.g., NH3 burns, nitrogen asphyxiation), not thermal injuries."
Employee Burned When Condenser Tank Overheats,On September 10 2021 Employee #1 was checking the fill levels of a large industrial condenser tank at a power plant. Due to a faulty thermostat the water reached near-boiling temperatures. When Employee #1 removed a secondary cover he was splashed with hot water on his arms. He was treated for burns at a nearby hospital.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the thermostat failure causing water to reach near-boiling temperatures, which directly created the hazardous condition. While pressurized water movement occurred, the root cause was extreme heat exposure (consistent with category definition and similar samples where faulty equipment caused scalding liquid contact). ""Struck by moving objects"" typically involves solid projectiles, whereas this case emphasizes temperature-induced injury as the primary unintended consequence."
One Worker Burned By Spilled Lava Rock Fill,At approximately 11:00 a.m. on June 6 2023 Employee #1 was handling newly heated lava rock fill for a specialty landscaping project. The rock had just been removed from a kiln and was still extremely hot. A transport container broke open spilling the hot material onto Employee #1’s lower legs causing second-degree burns.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the transport container breaking open, but the injury mechanism (second-degree burns) directly resulted from contact with hot lava rocks, not physical impact from falling objects. This aligns with ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" cases where injuries stem from heat transfer (e.g., hot tar splashes, overheated vapors), even if material movement initiated the exposure. The ""struck by falling object"" category requires injury via kinetic force from free-falling objects, which did not occur here."
Roofer'S Hand And Wrist Are Burnt By Hot Asphalt,At approximately 1:15 p.m. on november 7 2012 employee #1 a 26-year-old male with pioneer contractors inc. was working at a multi-employer construction project of a new construction of a hospital complex encompassing approximately seven acres. Pioneer contractors inc. had a written contract with the general contractor to install approximately 17 000 square feet of built-up type roofing system on the central utility plant building of the kaiser hospital project. Employee #1 was transferring molten roofing tar from a pitch kettle to a metal five-gallon tar bucket. The bottom of the tar bucket became stuck to the roof. As employee #1 attempted to work the tar bucket loose from the roof some of the molten tar spilled over to the top of the tar bucket and down into employee #1's glove. Employee #1 received serious burn injuries to his right wrist and hand in the event. Employee #1 was initially taken to kaiser hospital in oakland california for treatment of his injury and then transferred to st. francis hospital in san francisco california for further treatment. Employee #1 sustained serious burns to his right hand and wrist that required more than 24 hours of hospitalization. Based upon the documentary evidence gathered during the investigation it was concluded that the personal protective equipment did not eliminate preclude or mitigate the hazard of molten roofing tar spilling down employee #1's glove. This resulted in serious burns to his wrist and hand. The employer was a roofing contractor with approximately 13 years of experience and with eight employees on the job-site. Employee #1 was not a manager or supervisor and was working within his trade and at the task assigned to him.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The injury resulted from direct contact with molten roofing tar (a hot liquid), which qualifies as an extreme temperature hazard. While burns occurred, there was no fire or explosion��the molten tar spill itself was the first uncontrolled action. The ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" samples explicitly involve burns from hot substances (e.g., asphalt, tar) without combustion, aligning with this incident��s mechanism. ""Fires and explosion"" requires ignition or combustion, which is absent here."
Employee Burned By Hot Asphalt While Repairing Roof,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on october 11 2007 employee #1 was part of a twelve-man crew repairing the roof of an unoccupied single-story 250 000 sq ft building in city of industry ca. He was installing a cap sheet near a skylight and mopping hot asphalt when he walked backward slipped and fell onto freshly laid hot material. As he fell he tried to grab onto the asphalt mop cart to keep his balance but his left forearm went into the hot asphalt contained in the cart. Employee #1 suffered second-degree burns to his face and left forearm. He was transported to torrance memorial hospital where he was treated for approximately 12 days.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"While the incident began with a slip-and-fall event, the critical injury mechanism (second-degree burns) directly resulted from contact with hot asphalt, an extreme-temperature substance. The ""falls"" category describes injuries caused by the fall itself (e.g., fractures), whereas here, the fall merely positioned the worker into hazardous contact with the hot material. The samples under ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" demonstrate that burns caused by unintended contact with hot substances (even during a fall) are prioritized over the fall as the root cause."
Employee Dies From Heat Related Cardiac Arrest,On july 8 2011 employee #1 a bricklayer laborer was on his first day of work. He was putting mortar on boards and moving bricks and scaffold boards onto the fourth tier of a scaffold. The ambient temperature was between 91 and 94 degrees fahrenheit. He collapsed and died of cardiac arrest caused by heat exhaustion. His core temperature was determined to be 101.1 degrees fahrenheit.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The text explicitly attributes the cardiac arrest to heat exhaustion caused by ambient temperatures of 91–94°F. The ""first occurrence of uncontrolled or unintended action"" was the prolonged exposure to extreme heat during physical labor, which directly triggered the fatal medical event. While ""others"" includes medical incidents like heart attacks, the causal link to environmental heat exhaustion aligns with the definition of ""exposure to extreme temperatures,"" as seen in the category’s similar samples (e.g., heat-induced collapse with confirmed hyperthermia). The ""others"" samples, conversely, involve medical events without environmental causation (e.g., coronary atherosclerosis)."
Employee Suffers Burns When Hot Asphalt Spills,On july 1 2013 employee #1 was the designated hot lugger in a roofing project using hot liquid asphalt. After filling up the barrel on the roof with the hot asphalt the employee tripped slipped and lost his footing causing the hot liquid asphalt to spill out of the barrel and onto his face and hands. Employee #1's face shield had fallen off and the liquid got inside his gloves. Employee #1 was taken by ambulance to the burn unit at a local hospital where he was treated for burns to his face and hands. The employee remains hospitalized.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"While the slip/trip initiated the incident, the burns resulted directly from contact with hot asphalt, which aligns with the ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" definition. The injury stemmed from the hazardous substance (hot asphalt), not the fall itself. Similar samples under this category (e.g., slipping on sticky asphalt and spilling hot material) confirm that the primary cause is the exposure, even when a fall precedes it. Falls typically involve injuries from the fall��s impact (e.g., fractures), which is absent here."
Employee Burns Hand Pouring Hot Asphalt,At approximately 12:00 p.m. on september 6 2012 employee #1 sustained serious injuries when his left wrist was burned by hot rubberized asphalt. Employee #1 was attempting to pour hot rubberized asphalt on to the vertical surface of a planter above ground level. The rubberized asphalt was intended to be waterproofing for the planter. Employee #1 was treated and released for severe burns to his wrist and hand from the accident.,exposure to extreme temperatures,exposure to extreme temperatures,正确,"The injury resulted from direct contact with hot rubberized asphalt during pouring, which qualifies as ""extreme temperatures"" caused by a hot liquid. While asphalt is heated via fire-related processes, the first uncontrolled action here was unintended exposure to the hot substance itself, not combustion or explosion. The ""fires and explosion"" samples involve ignition events (e.g., torch use, fuel ignition), whereas this case aligns with burns from extreme heat transfer without flames/explosions."
Worker Is Injured In Fall From Attic,At approximately 11:55 a.m. on october 9 2009 employee #1 of holder's air conditioning & heating inc. was installing an hvac system. While installing the system he was on the beams in the attic of a house under construction when he fell approximately 11 feet. Employee #1 was hospitalized for skull fracture subarachnoid hemorrhage and pneumothorax.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident describes a fall from elevation (attic beams) without evidence of structural failure. The similar ""falls"" samples involve workers losing balance or stepping on unstable supports (e.g., wooden blocks), aligning with this incident. ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event, but the attic beams themselves were not described as collapsing or structurally compromised. The first unintended action was the fall itself, not a structural collapse."
Employee Falls From Walkway Into Empty Pool  Receives Injuri,At approximately 8:00 a.m. on september 1 2010 employee #1 a roofer and helper was throwing an electrical extension cord over the roof of a one-story single family residence while standing on a 6 ft wide concrete surface walkway between an empty swimming pool and the building. As he threw the electrical cord he lost his balance and fell approximately 8.33 ft into the empty swimming pool. He sustained serious and unspecified injuries that included fractures. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported him to a medical center where he was hospitalized and received medical attention over nine days.,falls,falls,正确,"The incident directly describes an uncontrolled fall from elevation (8.33 ft) due to loss of balance while performing a task, aligning with the ""falls"" definition of slips/trips or falls not caused by structural failure. While the empty pool introduces an unusual environmental factor, the first unintended action was the loss of balance and subsequent fall, which matches the ""falls"" category’s similar samples (e.g., roof falls from balance loss). The ""others"" category’s samples involve secondary hazards like drowning or equipment failure, which are not the primary cause here."
Employee Is Injured In Fall Through Skylight,"At 10:30 a.m. on june 29 2012 employee #1 was walking backwards unrolling a cap sheet (top ply of a built-up roofing membrane) while a coworker bent down holding the roll. Employee #1 fell through the unguarded skylight opening when he tripped backwards over the skylight curb. Employee #1 landed on the concrete floor below a fall height of approximately 21 feet and four inches. The skylight opening was eight feet long and four feet wide. Employee #1 was taken by ambulance to san francisco general hospital's emergency department for evaluation and treatment of his injuries. Employee #1's leg was splinted and the laceration to the bridge of his nose was sutured. Employee #1 was admitted for further observation at the trauma unit and was discharged the next day at 5:00 p.m. on july 16 2012 employee #1 was admitted at san francisco general hospital where he underwent surgery on his fractured left heel described as ""open reduction internal fixation of the left calcaneus fracture"" in the medical report. Employee #1 was discharged from the hospital on july 19 2012.",falls,falls,正确,"The accident’s first uncontrolled action was the employee tripping backward over the skylight curb, directly causing a fall from elevation. This aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slips/trips or falls from height not due to structural failure). The unguarded skylight is a contributing hazard, but the initial unintended action was the trip and fall, mirroring the ""falls"" category samples (e.g., backward falls through skylights during roofing work). The ""others"" category typically involves non-fall mechanisms (e.g., equipment failure, ejection), which do not apply here."
Employee Falls From A Roof,On may 21 2013 employee #1 of rafael construction inc. climbed out of a man basket onto a first story roof area and walked a short distance to the metal roof awning area on the building. Employee #1 stepped on a perforated metal sheet of the metal roof awning that gave way under his weight and fell approximately 13 feet to the grade of earth and gravel below. Employee #1 sustained serious injuries that required more than 24 hours of hospitalization.,collapse of object,falls,错误,"The perforated metal sheet (part of the roof awning structure) catastrophically failed under the employee’s weight, constituting a structural failure that directly initiated the fall. While the outcome was a fall, the primary cause was the collapse of the structural component, aligning with the ""collapse of object"" definition (""started with structural failure""). The ""falls"" category applies to slips/trips or falls not triggered by structural failure, which is not the initiating event here."
Foreman Is Injured In Fall,On april 22 2004 employee #1 a foreman with a roofing crew was preparing to remove and replace the existing roofing system on a 147-ft by 50-ft structure. He began to sweep the gravel ballast from the roof using a power broom before any fall protection was provided. While he was making a pass with his back to the edge of the roof the machine's drive wheel belt came off the pulleys. The foreman was pushed back and fell 21.5 ft to a paved area. He was hospitalized for fractured ankles.,falls,falls,正确,"While the power broom malfunction (belt dislodging) contributed to the loss of balance, the **initiating hazard** was the **lack of fall protection** while working at height. The injury mechanism (fall from elevation) aligns with the ""falls"" category definition, which explicitly includes falls due to loss of balance or misjudgment of edges without structural failure. The ""struck by moving objects"" category requires direct impact from a moving object (e.g., a machine part striking the worker), whereas here, the broom's malfunction indirectly caused a loss of balance, making the fall the primary cause. Similar ""falls"" samples (e.g., stepping off a roof edge, falling backward without equipment) reinforce this distinction."
Crew Leader Is Killed In Fall From Unguarded Platform,At approximately 10:05 a.m. on march 8 2013 employee #1 a carpentry crew leader employed by har construction co. llc was working at a construction site where a new six-story apartment complex with two stories of underground parking was being built. He was wearing a hard hat and had on his carpenter's belt. He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches wide and was not guarded on the north south and east sides. A gust of wind or some other factor caused employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to a concrete floor area on the third floor below a distance of approximately 10 feet 8.25 inches. He apparently did not strike or hit anything as he fell. He landed between two 2-foot by 4-foot wood braces that were positioned 5 feet 1.25 inches apart on the third floor. He landed face down striking his head on the concrete floor approximately 4 feet 4 inches from a wood framed wall. Employee #1's fall was witnessed by coworker #1 who was working on the third floor. Coworker #1 went to employee #1 and got no response. He then went and got help from one or more others at the work site. When they returned employee #1 was still unresponsive. There was a considerable amount of blood pooled around employee #1's head. Rescue personnel were called and when they arrived they pronounced employee #1 dead at the scene from massive head trauma. The subsequent investigation established that clark builders group llc was the general contractor for this work project. One of the subcontractors was agility construction llc which had the framing contract. Agility subcontracted all of the framing work to har construction co. llc with which agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the har employees) and the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager for agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the clark builders group officials. Har construction co. llc had 52 employees working at this site. They had been at the site since early january 2013. There were two foremen two crew leaders 16 carpenters and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for har construction co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall employee #1 was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the investigation coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00 a.m. when employee #1 while still up on the fourth floor walked over near the work area on the third floor where coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1 told employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to coworker #1 from either inside or outside the guarded area. After coworker #1 took the lumber employee #1 told coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform nearby. Within seconds employee #1 fell from the south side of the fourth floor platform to a concrete floor area on the third floor. All of the building's floors were made of wood except this concrete section on t,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall from an unguarded platform, directly aligning with the ""falls"" category definition (elevation falls not caused by structural failure). While the absence of guardrails constitutes a safety violation, the immediate cause of the accident was the fall itself, consistent with ""falls"" samples where lack of protection (e.g., no safety lanyard, unguarded edges) led to falls. The ""others"" category applies to non-standard scenarios (e.g., equipment failure, unique hazards), but here the core event��a fall from height��is explicitly covered by ""falls."""
Employee Falls From Elevation And Is Killed,On july 9 2003 employee #1 of abl inc. was walking atop a plywood walkway which was supported by planking between the bottom flanges of the i-beams of a bridge deck. Apparently one of the 4-in. By 8-in. Sheets of plywood slipped off the supports and as employee #1 stepped on it fell 50 ft to the ground. Employee #1 was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The plywood slipping off its supports represents an unstable surface failure rather than structural collapse. The walkway system itself (supports, beams) did not structurally fail; the plywood shifted due to inadequate securing or instability. This aligns with ""falls"" samples where unstable surfaces (e.g., unsecured decking) caused falls without structural failure. While ""collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the root cause (e.g., brackets/beams breaking), here the primary cause was the unstable walking surface triggering the fall."
Employee Is Killed In Fall From Beam,On may 23 2008 employee #1 an iron worker on a construction site was working from an i-beam. He was using an impact wrench to tighten bolts on the i-beam when he fell 42 feet from the beam. He sustained chest injury and was killed. He had not been using fall protection.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall from elevation while working on the I-beam, directly aligning with the ""falls"" category definition (slip/trip or fall from elevation not caused by structural failure). While the absence of fall protection is a contributing factor, the initial unintended action was the fall itself, consistent with the ""falls"" category��s similar samples (e.g., losing balance on a beam). The ""others"" category would apply only if the root cause were unrelated to the fall mechanics (e.g., equipment failure), which is not the case here."
Worker Demolishing Building Falls And Fractures Leg,At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 23 2013 employee #1 of aa max quality construction a residential construction company was engaged in demolition work at a fire-damaged residential building. He climbed a step ladder and then onto a 10-foot tall wall in order to cut the fire-damaged ceiling supports. He was using a reciprocating saw. He lost his balance and fell from the wall a distance of 10 feet. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital admitted and treated for a fractured left leg. During its subsequent investigation cal/osha determined that employee #1 had not been using fall protection.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident sequence begins with the worker losing balance while cutting ceiling supports on a wall, directly causing a 10-foot fall. This aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (falls from elevation not due to structural failure). The absence of structural collapse, equipment failure, or atypical circumstances (e.g., medical emergencies or snapped ropes in the ""others"" samples) confirms the primary uncontrolled action is the fall itself. While lack of fall protection contributed, it does not override the classification of the first unintended action as a fall."
Hvac Installer Is Seriously Injured In Fall From Roof,At approximately 8:30 a.m. on october 26 2012 employee #1 of bay air systems inc. was working at a multiemployer construction site a 24 hour fitness building. He and three coworkers were on the roof and laying out huge hvac machinery. The machinery was being lifted by helicopter from the ground to the roof. According to employee #1 he was standing on the corner end of the building and looking up at the helicopter waiting for the machinery to be lowered. He moved sideways. He later reported that as he moved he felt he was stepping onto the steel cover of a 24-inch square opening in the roof. He fell through the opening to concrete below. He was transported to eden medical center in castro valley where he was admitted and treated for five days for serious injuries. His injuries included but were not limited to fractured ribs fractured collar bone and fractured spine.,falls,falls,正确,"The incident originated from the worker stepping onto an unsecured or inadequately supported steel cover, which was not inherently a structural failure of the roof itself. The fall occurred due to the absence of proper safeguards (e.g., secure cover) rather than a structural collapse (e.g., rotting decking or buckling scaffold). While the steel cover��s failure enabled the fall, the primary cause aligns with ""falls"" as defined by slips/trips or falls from elevation unrelated to structural failure. The ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural elements (e.g., dry-rotted decking, failing equipment), whereas this case centers on a fall triggered by an unprotected opening."
Employee Killed In Fall From Bridge Pier,Employee #1 was assigned to make cuts in horizontal 24 in. Wide bridge beams under metal decking with concrete fill. Using an oxy-acetylene torch he was to burn approximately 6 in. Down approximately 14 ft across and approximately 6 in. Up again for each cut. Employee #1 was working from atop a concrete pier under the bridge decking and had limited crawl space and height. He had almost completed cutting on his first beam when he apparently tripped on material that had accumulated from a small break at the edge of the concrete pier or from some related cause. He pulled on the hose and then lost his balance and footing due to slack in the crossbracing of the bridge support. Employee #1 fell from the bridge pier and was killed. It is possible that hot sparks or insects also contributed to this accident. Employee #1 was not wearing a safety belt or lanyard nor was a net furnished. There were no eyewitnesses.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the trip on accumulated material, which directly initiated the fall sequence. While safety equipment absence is noted, the principle prioritizes the initial unintended physical event (tripping/falling) over systemic failures. The ""falls"" category explicitly covers slip/trip incidents from elevation, matching the accident��s root cause. The ""others"" category applies to non-mechanical/systemic issues not directly tied to a physical fall mechanism."
Employee Is Killed In Fall From Roof,On april 18 2005 employee #1 was part of an asbestos removal crew removing the old roof from a building. It consisted of metal panels and sections of glass windows reinforced with chicken wire. Employee #1 was wearing a harness and lanyard but was not tied off. He was unscrewing the bolts of one of the panels when he stepped backward and fell through the glass to the ground below. The distance from the roof to the ground was approximately 46 feet. He was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee stepping backward and losing balance, which directly caused the fall. While the glass panel (a structural element) failed under his weight, this failure was a consequence of the fall itself rather than an independent structural collapse. The sequence of events prioritizes the loss of footing as the initiating factor, aligning with ""falls"" definitions where structural integrity is not the root cause. The ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural failures preceding falls (e.g., scaffold collapse, broken rope), whereas here, the structural failure (glass breaking) occurred after the fall was already initiated."
Employee Is Injured In Fall Off Shear Wall,At approximately 12:30 pm. On july 12 2011 employee # 1 of harris salinas rebar inc. was repositioning himself on a shear wall on the new u.n.r. Living learning community (bld #004) reno nevada. The shear wall which was located on the northwest end of the project was approximately 40 feet in height with an excavated trench located below on the north side of the wall. Employee # 1 was working his way down the wall when he stopped to tie an area off apparently only connecting his one positioning hook and not his lanyard. Employee # 1 continued to work on the rebar when his positioning hook slid off the horizontal rebar member which had not been completely tied off at the intersection and fell to the north landing in the trench. Employee # 1 fell approximately 45 feet into the trench suffering injuries including fractured ribs.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the positioning hook sliding off the horizontal rebar due to incomplete tying, directly causing the fall from elevation. While improper safety equipment use (failing to secure the lanyard) contributed, the primary event aligns with ""falls"" as defined by slips/trips/falls from height not involving structural failure. The similar ""falls"" samples all describe falls triggered by equipment disengagement or loss of footing, whereas ""others"" samples involve atypical mechanisms (e.g., lifting injuries, rope failures unrelated to fall protection). The initial unintended action here is the fall itself, not the procedural safety violation."
Construction Worker Sustains Fractures In Fall From Roof,On february 14 2013 an employee was working for a construction firm. As he was climbing onto the roof of a single-story home to place his anchor he fell onto the flat roof of a garage below and then onto a concrete sidewalk. He sustained a serious head injury and fractured facial bones.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident sequence begins with the worker climbing onto the roof to place an anchor, followed by a fall without any indication of structural failure (e.g., roof collapse, dry rot, or instability). The ""collapse of object"" samples explicitly involve structural failures (e.g., dry rot decking, ladder failure) preceding falls, whereas this incident describes a direct fall from elevation. While ""climbing onto the roof"" might suggest instability, no structural failure is documented. The first uncontrolled action is the fall itself, aligning with the ""falls"" definition (slips/trips/falls from elevation not caused by structural failure)."
Employee Trips On Steel Pipe And Breaks Hip,On january 11 2006 employee #1 was carrying a box from the front office to the back of the building into the shop. He placed the box on the work bench and turned to return to the front office. As employee #1 was walking past the work bench he tripped over 20 to 25 pieces of 20-ft steel piping that was lying on the floor in front of the work bench. Employee #1 fell to the ground and broke his hip. He was hospitalized for 10 days.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee tripping over stationary steel pipes lying on the floor, directly causing the fall. While improperly placed pipes represent an environmental hazard, they were not in motion, and ""struck by moving objects"" requires an active moving object (e.g., machinery, swinging equipment). The trip itself aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slip/trip incidents), as the injury originated from the fall, not from contact with a dynamically moving object."
Employee Injured In Fall From Elevation,"Employee #1 was working as an apprentice steel worker. Employee #1 was using a manual ""crimper"" to join 3-ft by 28-ft steel deck panels together to form a floor. Employee #2 the foreman had warned employee #1 not to work walking backward but employee #1 continued to do so. Employee #1 walked backward into an unguarded stairwell opening falling 8 ft to the concrete landing and then another 8 ft 2in. To the concrete floor. Employee #1 suffered a fractured skull and a fractured back and was hospitalized.",falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee walking backward into an unguarded stairwell opening, directly causing the fall from elevation. While ""struck by moving objects"" requires interaction with a physical object in motion, the accident originated from the worker��s loss of balance and subsequent fall��not from being struck by an external object. The similarity to ""falls"" category samples (e.g., falling through unguarded openings or due to unsafe movement) reinforces this classification. The absence of a moving object impacting the victim eliminates ""struck by moving objects"" as the initiating event."
Employee Killed In Fall From Air Shaft,At approximately 11:45 a.m. on april 18 2002 employee #1 was removing a cover called a form from an air shaft. He fell 90 ft to the bottom of the shaft and was killed. The form was constructed of two 4-by-4s and a 3-by-4 sheet of 0.75-in. Plywood. The form was secured in place with four ellis jacks.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee falling 90 ft while removing the form. The form itself did not structurally collapse (it was secured with Ellis jacks), and there is no evidence of structural failure triggering the fall. While ""collapse of object"" requires initiating structural failure, this accident aligns with ""falls"" as defined by unintended elevation descent during work activity, consistent with similar samples where falls occurred without structural collapse (e.g., falling through hatchways or uncovered openings)."
Employee Falls From Ladder And Is Killed,On august 25 2012 employee #1 was working from a ladder and installing a brick board. As he worked he and the ladder fell to the ground. Employee #1 struck his head on the ground and died.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee and ladder falling due to loss of balance/stability during work at elevation, not structural failure. ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure (e.g., walkway collapse, broken chain) as the initiating event, while here the ladder fell *with* the worker due to motion during use, aligning with ""falls"" samples where workers lose balance on ladders. No structural defect in the ladder itself triggered the collapse."
Employee Falls Through Floor Opening  Receives Multiple Inju,On august 26 2010 employee #1 was stripping concrete forms from the underside of a roadway overpass. As he worked he fell through a floor opening in the walking way of the underdeck. He landed 20 ft below and struck the stripped material. Employee #1 sustained numerous serious injuries to his legs lower back and head. Emergency medical personnel were summoned and transported him to a medical center where he received treatment and was hospitalized.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident description specifies the worker fell through a pre-existing floor opening in the underdeck while stripping concrete forms. There is no evidence of structural failure (e.g., compromised integrity or collapse of the floor itself) preceding the fall. The opening was likely part of the worksite configuration, making the fall the first uncontrolled action. While stripping forms could theoretically destabilize the structure, the narrative does not describe structural collapse as the initiating event. The ""falls"" category aligns with similar samples where workers fell through openings or from elevation without structural failure, whereas ""collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the root cause (e.g., rotted decking breaking)."
Employee Dies In Fall Through Air Duct,Employee #1 a journeyman electrician at a construction site had been employed since august 13 1991. He left the ground floor work location to determine the reason for a power failure on the sixth floor. He fell 34 ft through an open 6 ft by 9 ft air duct shaft before reaching the sixth floor. Employee #1 died. Circumstances causing the fall remain unknown. Because work was not in progress workers were not on the mezzanine-level entry to witness the employee's fall through the air duct shaft.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident description explicitly states the employee fell through an open air duct shaft with no evidence of structural failure (e.g., collapse, dislodged components, or material degradation). The ""collapse of object"" samples consistently involve structural failures (e.g., walkway collapse, ladder detachment), while the ""falls"" samples align with unsecured openings or unprotected elevation falls. The open duct shaft here represents an unprotected hazard, not a structural failure, making ""falls"" the first uncontrolled action."
Employee Drowns After Falling From Bridge Tower,Employee #1 was working on a bridge tower that had been damaged when rammed by a ship. He was burning off bolts so that the damaged steel could be removed and replaced with new steel. Evidence reveals that he had completed the job and was moving to another position when he fell approximately 60 ft to the water. While falling employee #1 struck against the concrete counterweight rolled off the counterweight to the concrete foot of the tower and then bounced off the footing and fell onto the fender system from which he fell feet first into the water. The weight of his safety belt kept him under water and he drowned. He was not wearing a life vest.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall from elevation during positional movement on the bridge tower. While drowning (categorized under ""others"") caused the fatality, the principle mandates labeling the initial unintended event. The fall directly triggered the sequence of impacts and submersion, aligning with ""falls"" category samples where falls precede fatal outcomes (e.g., drowning). ""Others"" applies only when no prior category-specific action (like a fall) initiates the accident."
Drywall Installer Falls From Scissor Lift And Injures Head,On may 7 2013 employee #1 employed by a drywall contractor was working at a commercial warehouse building. He was working as a drywall taper spotting screws in the drywall in the main area of the warehouse from his position on a scissor lift (aerial lift). Employee #1 fell to the concrete floor of that working level. Coworker #1 employed by an electrical subcontractor also working at the facility found employee #1 lying prone unconscious and bleeding from a laceration on his forehead. Emergency services were called and the fullerton fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to university of california irvine medical center (uci) where he was admitted for observation and treatment of a head injury. The fullerton fire department reported this event to cal/osha on may 7 2013. Cal/osha's subsequent investigation determined that there were no witnesses to employee #1's fall. In addition employee #1 did not respond to attempts to be interviewed. The investigation did establish that work at the site began at 6:00 a.m. on may 7 2013 and that the workers all took their lunch break at 10:30 a.m. after the lunch break employee #1 continued with his assigned work and was alone on one side of the facility for approximately 20 minutes before he was found on the floor at approximately 12:24 p.m. by coworker #1 the subcontractor. When found employee #1 was lying on the floor approximately 6 feet away from the scissor lift which was in the down and stowed position. Employee #1 had worked as a drywall finisher for more than 11 years and had been a member of the drywall finishers regional local union 1136 since 2001. He was certified as an aerial lift power user and had received other specialized training related to his work from the union as well as site specific safety training from the employer.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident explicitly describes a fall from an elevated scissor lift, which aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (""falling from elevation but not due to structural failure""). While the root cause (e.g., medical event) remains unconfirmed, the first uncontrolled action is the fall itself - a physical descent from height. The ""others"" category samples involve non-fall mechanisms like cardiac arrests or rope failures with ejection, neither of which match the narrative. The lack of explicit slip/trip details does not negate the fall mechanism, as multiple ""falls"" samples (e.g., ladder falls without explicit triggers) demonstrate this category accommodates unexplained falls from elevation."
Employee Injures Back In Fall From Steel Structure,On may 31 2005 employee #1 was performing bolting functions on a steel structure when he slipped and fell 12 ft. He landed on an uneven foundation and suffered major back injuries. Employee #1 was wearing fall protection but was not connected at the time of the incident as he was moving his fall protection gear to another section. He was hospitalized.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the slip and fall from the steel structure, which directly aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slips/trips/falls from elevation not caused by structural failure). While procedural failure (not being connected to fall protection) contributed to the severity, the initiating event was the fall itself. The ""others"" category samples involve non-fall scenarios (e.g., equipment malfunctions, rope snaps) or ambiguous mechanisms, whereas all three ""falls"" reference samples explicitly describe falls from height due to slips/trips or loss of balance. The principle of labeling the first unintended action prioritizes the physical fall over procedural lapses."
Employee Injured In Fall With Roller,Employee #1 a co-owner of intercoastal concrete was operating a bomag sheep's foot vibratory roller concrete tamping machine to compact the soil in the driveway of a hillside lot prior to pouring the driveway. He was walking the machine backward when he fell off a 7 ft grade drop. The machine fell on top of him. Employee #1 suffered two broken femurs (compound fracture of the left) and groin and back injuries.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee falling off the 7 ft grade drop while operating the roller. This fall directly initiated the accident sequence (loss of control over the machine), and the machine subsequently striking the worker was a consequence of the fall. ""Falls"" aligns with the principle of labeling the initial unintended action (the fall from elevation), whereas ""struck by moving objects"" describes a secondary event caused by the fall. The machine��s motion was not independent (it fell due to the operator��s loss of control), distinguishing it from cases where moving equipment directly causes injury without prior loss of bodily control."
Employee Is Burned By Hot Rubber Sealant,On april 24 2009 employee #1 a roofer was carrying two five-gallon buckets of hot rubber sealant which was being used to coat the second floor. Employee # 1 reached the second floor and proceeded to walk on freshly applied rubber sealant. Both of his feet stuck to the surface and he lost his balance. The hot rubber sealant that he was carrying splashed from the buckets onto his body resulting in serious burns to his head and upper torso. His employer called for emergency medical assistance immediately and employee # 1 was transported by ambulance to a nearby medical center for treatment. He was then transferred to the st. francis memorial hospital burn center where he was hospitalized and received further treatment for his injuries.,exposure to extreme temperatures,falls,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the hot rubber sealant (a high-temperature liquid) splashing onto the employee due to loss of balance, causing thermal burns. While the sealant is a chemical material, the injury mechanism was explicitly thermal (""serious burns""), not toxic/corrosive. This aligns with ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" samples involving hot asphalt/tar burns. The ""chemical substances"" category requires harm from chemical toxicity/corrosiveness, which is absent here."
Employee Killed In Fall From Communications Tower,On june 7 2007 employee #1 age 19 was part of a crew installing reinforcing bars on the sides of a monopole cellular tower. Employee #1 was at a height of approximately 108 ft installing rigging equipment so the reinforcing materials could be hoisted to that level. When he climbed the tower his safety harness was connected to a cable lifeline that was equipped with a cable sliding device. Once employee #1 reached his working level he disconnected from the cable lifeline to reposition himself on the other side of the tower. On the front of his safety harness he had a pelican hook device that was used for positioning. Employee #1 also had a safety lanyard that was connected to the back of his safety harness. On the other end of the lanyard there was a rope grab device even though a rope lifeline had not yet been installed on the tower. Employee #1 apparently connected the pelican hook to the tower as he was observed from the ground leaning back on his harness and using both of his hands to move material. It is not known if the pelican hook came loose when employee #1 connected it to one of the climbing pegs on the tower or if he disconnected his hook to reposition himself. Employee #1 fell from the tower landing on the roof of a nearby building. He sustained multiple fractures lacerations and contusions to his head neck torso and extremities and died at the work site. The medical examiner's report listed the cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries. The report also stated that employee #1 had a high level of ethanol in his blood (0.13 percent) and vitreous (0.16 percent) as well as cannabinoids and nordiazepam. His coworkers admitted that they had drank alcohol the previous night until around midnight but all denied that they drank or consumed drugs on the day of the accident.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was Employee #1 disconnecting from the cable lifeline and relying on a non-functional rope grab device while repositioning, directly triggering the fall. This aligns with ""falls"" (disconnected safety equipment leading to a fall from elevation) rather than ""others,"" as the root cause centers on improper fall protection use during work at height, consistent with the ""falls"" definition and its similar samples (e.g., disconnected lanyards). While procedural failures occurred, the initial unintended action was the fall itself, not a systemic equipment malfunction or external hazard."
Employee Injured In Fall Descending Utility Pole,On january 24 2007 employee #1 a technician with comcast sacramento llc and a coworker arrived at a utility pole to disconnect a cable connection. After securing the surrounding area they inspected the pole and employee #1 donned his ppe. Using fixed steps he climbed the pole to the cable connection and then descended to adjust his climbing belt. Employee #1 went back up but was not comfortable working from the pole and he started to come down again. He was reaching for a step with his right hand when he accidentally grabbed foliage from a tree that surrounded the bottom portion of the pole. Employee #1 lost his balance and fell to the roadway. He suffered multiple pelvic fractures and a hairline fracture of his right wrist. The fire department responded and transported employee #1 to the uc-davis medical center in sacramento ca. He was released from the hospital on january 31 2007.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the loss of balance due to grabbing foliage, which directly precipitated the fall. While the foliage interaction is an environmental factor, the accident sequence (loss of balance �� fall from elevation) aligns with the ""falls"" category definition, which includes slips/trips and falls from non-structural causes. The ""others"" category applies to atypical mechanisms (e.g., equipment failure, vehicular accidents), but here the core event��uncontrolled descent due to loss of footing��matches ""falls"" precedents where slips/trips trigger falls, even with environmental contributors."
Carpenter Is Killed In Fall,On june 2 2005 employee #1 a framing carpentry foreman fell approximately 21 ft from the unprotected edge of third-story floor joists while attempting to set a structural beam. He was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident description explicitly states the worker fell from an unprotected edge while setting a structural beam, with no mention of structural failure (e.g., joists collapsing) preceding the fall. The ""collapse of object"" category requires structural failure as the initiating event, but the samples for this category (e.g., scaffold weld failure, floor collapse due to removed bracing) all demonstrate structural breakdown as the root cause. Here, the first uncontrolled action was the fall itself due to lack of fall protection, aligning with ""falls"" samples where falls occurred from unprotected edges without structural precursors."
Alarm System Estimator Sustains Fractures In Fall From Attic,At approximately 11:45 a.m. on april 2 2013 employee #1 was working as a salesman for a firm that installed fire and burglar alarms. He was working at a church in clovis ca. He was walking along some attic rafters gathering information for a cost estimate and a bid when he fell and struck the floor 30 feet (9.1 meters) below. He sustained several fractures.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action is the fall from attic rafters (elevation) while walking, directly causing fractures. This aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slips/trips or falls from elevation without structural failure). While the context (salesman in an attic) differs from typical ""falls"" samples (e.g., roofing/ladder work), the core mechanism��uncontrolled descent from height��matches the category. The ""others"" samples involve secondary triggers (e.g., rope failure, medical events), which are absent here. The principle of labeling the first unintended action prioritizes the fall itself over the non-traditional work setting."
Employee Falls Down Shaft  Suffers Contusions,At approximately 12:40 p.m. on august 9 2008 employee #1 was planting a tree near an opening. The tree needed to be planted at a small area near a wall and next to an opening. Employee #1 tried to gain access and went under caution tape and stepped onto a board used to cover an opening 22-ft by 3-ft 5-in. And 15-ft 4-in. Deep. The opening was an intake air shaft for the generator. The board did not support his weight and he fell to the bottom of the shaft. Employee #1 sustained contusions to his right hip left elbow and right palm. Employee #1 was hospitalized for approximately eight hours.,falls,falls,正确,"The board covering the shaft failed due to inadequate support for the employee��s weight, but this failure is not a structural collapse of a building component (e.g., roof, wall, deck). The primary cause is the fall triggered by the unstable surface (board), aligning with ""falls"" samples where workers fell due to unsecured materials (e.g., plywood flipping). ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the root cause, which is absent here (the board served as a temporary cover, not a structural element). The injury mechanism (fall) directly stems from the unstable surface, not a structural collapse."
Employee Fractures Spine In Fall From Deck,On july 5 2013 employee #1 a carpenter was working at the perimeter of a deck to replace the temporary railing with a finish railing. The temporary railing was removed. The employee lost his balance and fell approximately 11 ft striking his back on the ground. A coworker called emergency rescue services and employee #1 was taken by ambulance to the san francisco general hospital. Employee #1 was treated for three fractures on his spine. Employee #1 was hospitalized for six days.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee losing balance, directly causing the fall. While the temporary railing��s removal preceded the fall, it was a planned work activity (replacing railings), not an unintended structural failure. The ""collapse of object"" category requires structural failure (e.g., deck collapse, beam failure) as the initiating event. Here, no structural collapse occurred��the fall resulted from loss of balance, aligning with ""falls"" samples where slips/trips or balance loss triggered the accident."
Worker Falls When Hatch Door Opens  Fractures Leg And Wrist,At approximately 2:30 p.m. on september 27 2012 employee #1 and coworkers of valley fire & security alarms inc. were working in a commercial building. They were installing low voltage electrical cable part of a fire alarm system installation for a new tenant space. This work involved accessing an elevated service attic corridor. Employee #1 and coworkers entered the service attic corridor via an extension ladder. Coworker #1 spooled out the cable as employee #1 walked the cable down the corridor attaching it along the wall as he went. Employee #1 stepped away from the wall to determine the appropriate route for running the cable across the service corridor and down into the tenant space. Employee #1 stepped onto a closed hatch door in the service corridor floor. The hatch door opened downward and the employee fell approximately 13 feet feet first to the ground below. Emergency responders transported employee #1 to mercy hospital folsom ca. He was initially treated and then admitted for a total of three days hospitalization. He underwent surgery for a fracture to the right leg fibula tibula and ankle and a fracture to the right wrist. At the time of this report the employee had undergone two additional inpatient surgeries subsequent to the initial hospitalization and he was receiving in-home health care support for ongoing treatment.,falls,falls,正确,"The incident occurred when the employee stepped onto a closed hatch door that unexpectedly opened, leading to a fall. While the hatch door��s movement might suggest structural failure, the event aligns with ""falls"" as defined by a loss of balance/contact (stepping onto an unsecured surface) rather than structural collapse. The ""collapse of object"" examples involve structural components (scaffolds, ladders) failing independently, whereas here, the hatch door��s opening was directly triggered by the worker��s action, resembling unsecured surface hazards in the ""falls"" samples (e.g., unsecured plywood). Thus, the primary cause is the fall mechanism, not structural failure."
Employee Is Killed In Fall Off Tower,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on august 11 2011 several employees were tasked with dismantling an anderson m-46 100-ft cellular tower that was no longer needed. This tower was located on the south side of image road between highway 11 and inman road. The tower was assembled using five 20-ft triangular sections with saddles bolted to the legs to attach one section to the next making the tower progressively taller. There was a triangular platform on top of the tower housing the cellular antennas. After the antenna platform had been removed three of the employees climbed the faces of the tower to approximately 80 feet to unbolt the top section of the tower for removal by a truck mounted crane. Employee #1 fell from the tower 80 feet to the ground below. Emergency medical services were notified and arrived within minutes. Employee #1 was alive but unresponsive. He was transported by air ambulance to university hospital where he died shortly after arrival.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall from elevation during dismantling work. While unbolting the tower section was part of the process, the text does not explicitly describe structural failure (e.g., tower section dislodging/collapsing) preceding the fall. The ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural failures (e.g., ladder dislodged, wire rope broke) directly causing falls, whereas here the fall itself is the initiating event, consistent with ""falls"" category definitions and similar samples."
Worker Falls From Ladder And Sustains Multiple Injuries,On june 19 2013 employee #1 of source refrigeration & hvac inc. was working on a roof at the grocery outlet. As he exited the roof onto a ladder he lost his grip on the ladder. He fell 10 feet to the ground. Then the ladder fell on top of him. Emergency services were called. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was admitted and treated for a concussion to the right side of his head a fracture of the right ankle and a fracture of the lower right leg.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the worker losing his grip and falling from the ladder (a fall from elevation), which directly initiated the accident sequence. While the ladder subsequently fell and struck him, this was a secondary consequence of the initial fall. The ""falls"" category explicitly covers elevation-related falls not caused by structural failure, aligning with the principle of labeling the earliest unintended action."
Employee Falls Onto Rocks And Dies,An employee was building a form on a bridge over the buckatunna creek in buckatunna mi. The form was the connection point for the inner concrete beams of the bridge. He fell 11 feet 8 inches into the riprap below and died.,falls,falls,正确,"The text explicitly describes a fall from elevation (11 feet 8 inches) without evidence of structural failure initiating the event. The form being built is described as a connection point for beams, but no structural collapse or failure of the form itself is mentioned. The ""collapse of object"" samples involve clear structural failures (e.g., walkway giving way, trench wall collapsing), whereas here the uncontrolled action is the fall itself. This aligns with the ""falls"" category definition and its similar samples, which prioritize labeling the first unintended action (the fall) rather than inferring unstated structural failure."
Employee Is Injured In Fall From Rebar Cage,At or about 9:30 a.m. on june 18 2012 an iron worker was walking on top of a grade beam rebar cage to move rebar. The employee lost his balance. The employee tried prevent himself from falling so he grab at one of the rebar but missed it. The employee fell from the grade beam into an adjacent excavation. The employee sustained a fracture of his right leg and was hospitalized.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident��s first uncontrolled action was the employee losing balance while walking on the rebar cage, directly triggering the fall. This aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slip/trip/fall from elevation without structural failure). The ""others"" category samples involve non-fall mechanisms (e.g., rope snap, equipment shift), whereas this scenario matches the ""falls"" samples where balance loss precedes injury. Structural integrity was not compromised, eliminating ""collapse of object"" considerations."
Employee Is Injured In Fall Through Hole In Floor,On january 7 2012 employee # 1 a 22-year- old male was working as a general laborer at a multi-employer worksite. Employee # 1 picked up a 4-ft by 8-ft sheet of plywood that had been placed over the floor opening. As he stepped forward with the plywood in front of him he fell through a 42-inch by 72-inch floor opening 12-ft down to the floor below. The plywood was not secured or marked to identify the fall hazard that it was covering. Employee # 1 sustained fractures to four transverse vertebrae. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital and was hospitalized for three days. The accident was reported to the division by the fire department.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee falling through an unsecured floor opening from elevation, which directly aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (falls from elevation not due to structural failure). While the unsecured plywood reflects a safety violation, the principle mandates labeling the **first unintended action** (the fall itself), not the pre-existing hazard. Similar ""falls"" samples involve falls through unmarked/unsecured openings, whereas ""others"" samples involve non-fall events (e.g., heart attacks, equipment failures). The fall here is the initiating event, not a residual consequence of broader violations."
Worker Falls Through Skylight And Is Killed,At approximately 6:00 p.m. on april 3 2012 employee #1 was working for a plumbing heating and air conditioning contractor. The incident occurred at a retail store distribution warehouse. Employee #1 was a full-time permanent employee of the employer. He was not an employee of the retail distribution center. Employee #1 was conducting the startup procedures for a roof-mounted condenser unit. He was on the west side of the condenser unit. The condenser unit was 89 inches (2.26 meters) east of a skylight that was covered with acrylic plastic such as plexiglas. According to a witness employee #1 was facing east and talking on his cell phone. He stood up and took a step or two backwards. He then appeared to stumble or trip on his foot and fall backwards onto the skylight breaking the acrylic plastic or plexiglas cover. He fell approximately 39 feet (11.9 meters) to the concrete floor below. Employee #1 received blunt force trauma injuries to multiple parts of his body and he was killed. The causal factors were that employee #1 was not wearing a fall protection device that was appropriately secured and that the skylight was not guarded or protected.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the worker stumbling/tripping while stepping backward, directly causing the fall through the skylight. While the unguarded skylight contributed to the severity, the initiating event��a slip/trip leading to a fall from elevation��aligns with the ""falls"" category definition. The ""others"" category applies to hazards not covered by specific classes, but here the root cause (loss of balance/fall) is explicitly defined under ""falls"", as demonstrated by the similar samples where falls through skylights due to tripping/missteps are classified as ""falls""."
Employee Fell 18 Feet While Erecting A Steel Beam,On january 24 2002 employee #1 a connector fell approximately 18.5 feet during a steel erection process while trying to make connection. He was wearing the appropriate fall protection equipment but the equipment was not tied off at the time of the accident. He died at the scene.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall itself during the steel erection process, which directly aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (fall from elevation not caused by structural failure). While the procedural failure (untied equipment) contributed to the severity, the initiating event was the fall, consistent with the ""falls"" category samples where falls occurred due to lanyard disengagement or improper tie-off. The ""others"" category applies to non-fall scenarios (e.g., equipment snap, medical collapse) or cascading consequences, which are not the root cause here."
Employee Falls From Scaffold  Injures Foot,On june 10 2008 employee #1 was working on a scaffold approximately 16 feet above the ground without adequate fall protection in a section of scaffolding where the midrails were missing. Employee #1 fell to the concrete sidewalk sustaining a serious foot injury.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident sequence begins with the absence of midrails (a missing safety feature), which created an unsafe condition but did not constitute structural failure of the scaffold itself. The first uncontrolled action was the worker's fall from elevation due to inadequate fall protection, consistent with ""falls"" category samples where falls occur without structural collapse. While missing midrails contributed to the hazard, the scaffold remained intact (no collapse/buckling), distinguishing it from ""collapse of object"" cases where structural failure directly initiated the accident (e.g., walkway collapse, bracket puncture)."
Worker Sustains Multiple Fractures In Fall From Ladder,On august 23 2013 employee #1 an electrician employed by an electrical contractor was installing lighting fixtures inside a three-story house under construction. He was in the process of wiring a ceiling light on top of a spiral stairwell. The light fixture was 9 feet above the third floor landing and approximately 42 feet above the bottom of the stairwell. Employee #1 was working from a 6-foot a-frame ladder that he had set up on the third floor next to the staircase railing. While standing on the ladder he had to reach out 3.5 feet from the staircase railing to access the ceiling light fixture. He lost his balance. Employee #1 fell approximately 36 feet to the bottom floor. Emergency services were called. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for body trauma including multiple fractures. He required hospitalization for three weeks. The employer reported this incident to cal/osha on august 23 2013. The subsequent investigation determined that employee #1 was regularly employed by the employer and was not a contract employee.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the worker losing balance while reaching from the ladder, directly causing the fall. While the ladder setup (e.g., placement near the railing) might raise questions about structural stability, the text does not indicate the ladder itself failed or collapsed. The ""collapse of object"" category requires structural failure as the initiating event, which is absent here. The accident sequence aligns with ""falls"" (loss of balance �� fall from elevation), matching the Top-3 ""falls"" samples where falls occurred due to slips/trips or unstable positioning, not structural collapse."
Employee Fractures Arm In Fall From Roof,At about 11:15 a.m. on february 6 2004 employee #1 was working alone on the roof of an existing 2-story private residence removing old gutters from the edge of the pitched roof. As he was extracting the last nail he fell from the edge of the roof to the ground. Employee #1 fractured his arm and was hospitalized.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall itself during routine roof work (removing gutters). While the task involved manual labor, the accident sequence began with the slip/fall from elevation without prior structural failure or non-fall-related hazards. The ""others"" category samples involve secondary triggers (e.g., rope/pulley failure, medical collapse), whereas here the fall directly initiated the injury, aligning with the ""falls"" definition of elevation-related accidents without structural causes."
Employee Is Killed When He Falls From Elevation Into Bay,"At approximately 1:45 p.m. on july 30 2004. an employee was vacuuming a platform measuring 30 feet by 30 feet located at the base of pier 30 on the richmond-san rafael bridge. The bridge was being seismically retrofitted. A nearby employee was lowering a 1 800 pound ""jacking frame"" from a height of 80 feet using an ingersoll-rand winch model hu serial no. 188. The winch manufacturer required the unit to be ""in gear"" for this operation. However the employee used the brake only. The load did not stop and crashed through the platform floor creating a hole approximately 10 feet by 5 feet. The employee on the platform fell into the hole and struck his head on the structural steel as he fell into the bay. The employee was killed.",falls,falls,正确,"The employee��s fatal injury resulted from a fall through a hole created by the jacking frame crashing into the platform. While the jacking frame��s uncontrolled fall initiated the sequence, the primary cause of death was the fall from elevation, which aligns with the ""falls"" category (excludes structural failure as the root cause). ""Struck by falling object"" does not apply because the employee was not directly struck by the falling jacking frame but fell due to the platform��s structural failure caused by it."
Employee Injured In Fall From Moving Scaffold,Employee #1 and a coworker were using a 5 to 6 ft tall rolling scaffold to remove duct work as part of an asbestos remediation project. The scaffold had to be moved occasionally and the workers had been instructed to remain seated during this procedure. At the time of the accident employee #1 decided to stand and to hang onto the duct work as the scaffold moved. When he finally let go he fell backward to the floor striking his head and sustaining a small laceration on his elbow from hitting a piece of metal. The scaffold had no guardrails.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee��s decision to stand and release his grip on the duct work while the scaffold was moving, directly causing the fall. While the absence of guardrails contributed to the hazard, the initiating event was the fall itself, which aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (falls from elevation not due to structural failure). The ""others"" category would apply only if the root cause was entirely unrelated to elevation (e.g., procedural failures without a fall), which is not the case here."
Employee Injured In Fall From Edge Of Roof,Employee #1 was operating a roof runner seaming machine on a 28 ft high roof. The operation required him to reach over the edge of the roof and roll the seaming machine out onto a wooden jig so it could start at the edge of the roof. Something slipped and employee #1 and the machine fell to the ground. He suffered several broken bones. Employee #1 was not wearing any type of fall arrest system nor was any other type of fall protection provided.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the slip that directly caused the fall from elevation. While the machine��s movement occurred during the event, the slip (a loss of balance/traction) initiated the accident sequence. The ""struck by moving objects"" examples involve external objects actively striking workers (e.g., machinery recoiling, trees kicking back), whereas here, the machine��s motion was a concurrent result of the slip, not the root cause. The lack of fall protection further aligns this with ""falls"" cases where uncontrolled descent (not object impact) is the primary hazard."
Employee Injured In Fall When Support Beam Breaks,On july 27 2002 employee #1 and some coworkers were installing plywood decking and 2-in. By 6-in. Support beams as a working deck at a bridge site when one of the beams broke. Employee #1 fell 16 ft onto the pavement. Employee #1 sustained serious injuries and was hospitalized.,collapse of object,falls,错误,"The accident was directly triggered by a structural failure (support beam breaking), which aligns with the ""collapse of object"" definition. While the fall resulted from this collapse, the initiating event was the beam’s structural failure, making it the primary cause. The ""falls"" category explicitly excludes structural failure as a root cause, confirming this decision."
Employee Falls From Beam And Suffers Multiple Injuries,On june 13 2013 employee #1 was performing framing activities at a single family residence under construction. Employee #1 attempted to attach one beam to another by inserting a lag bolt into the wood with a right angle drill. The drill hung up in the wood resulting in employee #1 losing his balance and falling off of the beam to the ground below. Employee #1 was transported to a local hospital for evaluation. Employee #1 was then transferred to a larger hospital for treatment of a fractured neck broken ribs and cracked vertebrae. Employee #1 underwent surgery and was hospitalized for four days.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee losing balance due to the drill ""hanging up"" during normal tool operation, directly triggering the fall. While the drill resistance initiated the sequence, it constitutes a routine operational hazard rather than a distinct equipment failure or external hazard (e.g., structural collapse, chemical exposure). The ""falls"" category explicitly covers balance loss during elevation work, as demonstrated in its similar samples (e.g., slipping on scaffolds, losing grip on beams). The ""others"" category applies to non-mechanical cascades (e.g., rope snaps, load shifts), which are absent here. The root cause aligns with ""falls"" as defined."
Bricklayer Fell 19 Feet Down Unguarded Elevator Shaft,On december 19 2008 employee #1 a bricklayer working on a project that was renovating an old department store into condominiums fell 19-feet down an unguarded elevator shaft. At the time of the fall employee #1 was laying bricks to repair a sewer line.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident description emphasizes a fall from elevation (19 feet) into an unguarded elevator shaft during routine work. While the unguarded shaft represents a safety hazard, there is no structural failure or collapse (e.g., no walkway, scaffold, or component giving way). The first uncontrolled action is the fall itself, consistent with ""falls"" samples involving unprotected elevator shafts. ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure initiating the event, which is absent here."
Employee Falls From Metal Decking And Is Killed,At approximately 1:15 p.m. on july 29 2013 employee #1 an ironworker was installing a metal deck on a mezzanine. The height of the mezzanine was approximately 14.5 ft above the floor surface. The decking pieces were 36 in. By 36 in. And they were attached to the steel beams of the mezzanine. As he was adjusting the pieces the materials shifted and he fell from the elevated location. Employee #1 sustained traumatic injuries in the fall and died.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident��s first uncontrolled action was the shifting of materials during adjustment, which directly caused the fall. While the decking movement could imply instability, the text does not describe structural failure (e.g., beams breaking or attachments collapsing). The ""falls"" category aligns with unintended movement during work at height, consistent with similar samples where falls occurred due to balance loss or unstable positioning, not structural collapse."
Fall From Beam,An employee fell 34 feet when the beam he was walking on tipped over as he was travelling to a work platform. Another employee was welding on the platform. The employee doing the welding was secured with a life line to the work platform. Employee #1 was getting material for the other employee to weld to a metal beam. Employee #1 climbed the ladder walked on the beam and handed the material to the welder. Employee #1 then started back to the work platform but the metal beam tipped over and he fell hitting a metal fan six feet from the ground and then the ground. Employee #1 received compress fractures of the vertebra and two broken toes.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the beam tipping over due to instability or improper balance during movement, not structural failure. While the beam��s movement caused the fall, there is no evidence of structural collapse (e.g., removed supports, corroded materials). The ""falls"" category explicitly addresses falls from elevation triggered by unstable surfaces, aligning with the worker losing balance on a shifting beam. ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the root cause, which is absent here."
Worker Falls Through Hole In Roof And Breaks Wrist And Rib,On june 20 2013 employee #1 a roofer employed by priority roofing solutions inc. was working on a roof repair at a commercial building. He was working at a height of 18 feet 1 inch pulling off dry rot plywood. When he removed the plywood he fell through the hole created. He fell onto the duct work below the roof and then through the ceiling which was 13 feet above the floor. Emergency services were called and employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was admitted and treated for a left wrist fracture and a rib fracture. He was hospitalized for two days.,falls,falls,正确,"The accident occurred when the worker fell through a hole created by removing dry rot plywood, which was part of the intentional work process. While the hole��s creation could be misconstrued as a localized structural failure, the root cause was the fall from elevation triggered by loss of footing/balance during routine roof repair. The ""collapse of object"" category requires structural failure (e.g., scaffold buckling, beam snapping) to initiate the incident chain, whereas here, the hole was a direct result of deliberate plywood removal, not an independent structural collapse. The ""falls"" samples (e.g., slipping off a roof edge, losing balance on a ladder) align with this scenario, as the fall itself��not a prior structural failure��was the primary cause."
Employee Killed In Fall From Bridge Under Construction,On september 10 2001 employee #1 was part of a crew installing sheet metal decking panels on a bridge under construction. Before installing the final panel the crew disconnected their lanyards from the harnesses they were wearing. With the final panel in position over the opening employee #1 was standing on it preparing to fasten it in place. One side of this panel slipped from its support brackets employee #1 fell through the opening about 56 feet to the ground and was killed. The crew assumed the metal panel would provide adequate fall protection however the panel had apparently been cut too small to fit in its support brackets.,collapse of object,falls,错误,"The initiating event was the sheet metal panel slipping from its support brackets due to being cut too small (structural failure), directly causing the fall. While the fatal outcome resulted from the fall, the primary cause aligns with ""collapse of object"" as defined by structural failure during installation. The ""falls"" category applies to accidents not triggered by structural failure (e.g., unsecured panels, improper harness use), which is secondary here."
Employee Is Injured In Fall From Street Level Down Shaft,At approximately 11:38 a.m. on february10 2011 employee # 1 was working for leonard's roofing as a roofer assigned to the tar kettle. Employee # 1 was directing a truck onto the construction site near the tar kettle so that leonard martinez could go and pick up asphalt needed for the job. He apparently moved the unsecured and illegibly marked wooden cover to an hvac shaft and fell approximately 24 feet down to level p-2. Employee # 1 sustained a serious head injury multiple fractures and possible internal injuries. Employee # 1 was transported to ucla medical center westwood where he underwent three surgeries for a fractured skull and other fractures and was hospitalized for approximately one month. The accident was reported to dosh by the los angeles city fire department on february 10 2011.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fall itself, triggered by the employee moving an unsecured cover. While the unsecured cover introduced a hazard, the accident sequence directly aligns with ""falls"" (fall from elevation without structural failure). The ""others"" category applies to non-mechanical/non-environmental hazards (e.g., medical emergencies, snapped ropes), which are not present here. The ""falls"" samples consistently show falls from height due to slips/loss of balance, matching this scenario."
Employee Killed In Backward Fall Off Roof,On september 6 2000 employee #1 was using a chalk line to mark outside the warning line system of a low-sloped roof when he fell off backward approximately 25 ft onto a blacktop road. He was killed. At the time of the accident the safety monitor was on another section of the roof.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee falling backward off the roof while working outside the warning line system, directly aligning with the ""falls"" definition (fall from elevation unrelated to structural failure). While the absence of a safety monitor is a procedural failure, it is a systemic violation that enabled the accident but does not constitute the initial unintended action. The fall itself triggered the fatal outcome, mirroring the ""falls"" category��s similar samples where unprotected falls from heights are the primary cause."
Worker Sustains Concussion In Arrested Fall,On june 20 2013 employee #1 of associated cement contractors inc. was engaged in forming work as part of the construction of a new parking structure. He was working on the sixth floor when he slipped and fell to the concrete form. He hit the edge of the form and then bounced and hit the support for the scaffold. His retractable fall arrest device locked and arrested his fall. He was suspended just above the fifth floor. Emergency services were called. Employee #1 was rescued and transported to the hospital. He was admitted and treated for a concussion.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the worker slipping and falling from elevation, which directly aligns with the ""falls"" category definition (slips/trips/falls not caused by structural failure). While the injury involved impacts with objects during the fall, these are consequences of the initial fall event. The fall arrest system's activation is a secondary safety response, not the root cause. The ""others"" category samples involve distinct mechanisms like equipment failures (snapped ropes) or health crises unrelated to falls, which do not match this scenario. The chronological sequence prioritizes the slip/fall as the triggering event."
Employee Fall From Roof,On march 2 2004 at approximately 1220 hours the cal/ osha oakland district office employee #1 a carpenter 47 years old was bolting a beam to a concrete wall on the ground floor of a two-story building under construction. Instead of fully opening the ladder he partially opened it and propped it against the concrete floor with employee #1 falling down with it as a result he sustained closed pelvis pubis and sacral fractures. Employee #1 was hospitalized for about 25 hours for medical examination and observation.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ladder��s instability due to improper setup (partially opened and propped), which directly caused the fall. While the ladder��s failure resembles a structural-like collapse, ""collapse of object"" specifically requires structural failures (e.g., beams, walls) as the initiating event. Here, the ladder is equipment, not a structural component, and its misuse aligns with ""falls"" (e.g., unstable positioning leading to a fall). The ""collapse of object"" samples involve structural elements failing, whereas this accident stems from improper ladder use, matching ""falls"" definitions and similar cases."
Employee Killed In Fall Through Roof Opening,On october 30 2007 employee #1 was repairing the sheet metal on a low-sloped roof. He removed a sheet metal panel and accidentally stepped into the opening falling approximately 28 ft to the floor of the building. Employee #1 was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee accidentally stepping into the opening created by removing the sheet metal panel, directly causing the fall from elevation. This aligns with the ""falls"" definition (fall from elevation not due to structural failure). While the unguarded opening represents a hazard, the triggering event��the fall itself��is the primary uncontrolled action. The ""others"" category is reserved for non-standard scenarios (e.g., equipment failure, non-work-related incidents), which do not apply here. The similar ""falls"" samples explicitly involve falls through openings during roofing work, reinforcing this classification."
Employee Falls Into Trench And Is Injured,At approximately 10:41 a.m. on november 5 2013 employee #1 and a coworker were uncovering a trench which had water pipes laid into the trench. The trench was about 6 ft deep 7 ft wide and 12 ft long covered by three heavy metal plates. Both employees were using a mobile crane mounted on a truck to lift the metal plates one by one. However after lifting up the first metal plate the employees realized that load was not as stable as it should be. Therefore the coworker told employee #1 to extend the outriggers of the crane and set up wood cribbing underneath the footing of the outriggers because the crane-truck was parked on a slightly sloped area. Employee #1 had his back towards the open trench while he was sitting on the ground and was setting up the cribbing. Employee # 1 was about 4.5 ft away from the open trench while cribbing. As he finished the cribbing and got up he forgot about the open trench behind him and took two to three steps backwards falling into the trench. He struck his back on a valve attached to the water pipes which were about 3 ft high above the trench surface. Employee #1 suffered serious injuries to his spine and he was hospitalized for approximately three days at a medical center.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee forgetting the open trench and stepping backward, directly causing the fall. While the valve impact occurred during the fall, it was a stationary object and a secondary consequence. ""Falls"" captures the initial unintended movement (stepping backward into the trench), whereas ""struck by moving objects"" requires an external moving object striking the victim, which did not occur here. The valve strike was a result of the fall, not a preceding event."
Roofer Falls 40 Feet And Dies While Wearing Ppe,On february 17 2009 employee #1 a 51-year-old male construction worker with heldreth construction was working approximately forty-feet above the ground installing roof decking. Employee #1 was using a harness and retractable lanyard attached to a roof anchor when he fell. The force of the fall pulled the anchor away from the decking to which it was attached allowing the employee to fall. Employee #1 was killed in the fall.,falls,falls,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the anchor detaching from the decking during the fall, which directly caused the fatal outcome. While the anchor��s detachment could superficially resemble structural failure, the ""collapse of object"" category requires the accident to **originate** from structural failure (e.g., dry rot decking collapsing). Here, the fall itself (triggered by inadequate anchor attachment or force dynamics) preceded the anchor��s detachment, aligning with ""falls"" samples where safety system failures (e.g., unsecured lanyards, wind gusts) directly caused the fall. The decking��s structural integrity was not the root cause, distinguishing it from ""collapse of object"" cases."
Employees Injured By Unplanned Detonation,Some employees were excavating a hole for an electric light pole. They had drilled two holes and loaded them with two to five sticks of 40 percent dynamite. They were using a 6-volt battery to detonate the dynamite when an unplanned detonation occurred injuring both employees. They were hospitalized for their injuries.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the unplanned detonation of dynamite, which directly caused injuries via explosive force. While debris from the explosion could align with ""struck by moving objects,"" the root cause is the detonation itself��an uncontrolled explosive event. ""Fires and explosion"" captures the initiating action, whereas ""struck by moving objects"" describes a secondary effect. The samples for ""fires and explosion"" emphasize explosions as primary events (e.g., gas mixtures igniting, flammable vapors exploding), whereas ""struck by moving objects"" samples involve external forces (e.g., backhoe hitting dynamite, battery exploding). Here, the detonation was the initial unintended action, not a consequence of an external impact."
Employee Injured In Fire,At approximately 2:16 p.m. on october 30 2000 employee #1 was painting wood cabinetry using a flammable solvent-based paint inside of a single family home when a flash fire caused second-degree burns to his arms and hands. The painting contractor (sole proprietor) also received serious burn injuries as a result of the fire. The two injured persons were transported by paramedics to the arrowhead regional medical center in colton for treatment and hospitalization. (the injured employer was not listed on an injury line on the original form.),fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ignition of flammable solvent vapors, which directly caused the flash fire and subsequent burns. While flammable chemicals were present, the accident��s initiating event was the fire itself, not direct chemical contact (e.g., splashes or leaks). ""Fires and explosion"" aligns with the principle of labeling the first unintended action (ignition), whereas ""exposure to chemical substances"" would require harm from chemical contact prior to combustion, which did not occur here."
Two Workers Die In Flash Fire,At approximately 11:10 on february 1 1994 employees #1 and #2 were at a sewage treatment plant installing two large butterfly valves into an effluent channel. Employee #2 was at the bottom of the channel which had been pumped down to a workable level so that the new valve could be installed. Employee #2 was using a pneumatic chipping hammer on the concrete walls when a flash fire occurred completely engulfing him in flames. Employee #1 who observed the fire from his standpoint jumped into the channel to help employee #2. Employee #1 caught on fire as soon as he jumped into the channel. Both employees received second-degree burns over 60 to 80 percent of their bodies. Employees #1 and #2 were transported and admitted to uci burn center for emergency treatment. Employee #2 died on february 3 1994 and employee #1 died on february 4 1994. The cause of death in both cases was the extensive second-degree burns that the employees sustained.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ignition of flammable vapors (likely methane/hydrogen sulfide) by the pneumatic chipping hammer, directly causing the flash fire. While chemical vapors were present, the accident��s triggering event was the fire itself, not direct chemical contact. The burns resulted from the fire��s flames, aligning with ""fires and explosion"" samples where ignition (e.g., fuel spills, sparks) directly caused injuries. ""Exposure to chemical substances"" requires direct contact with toxic/corrosive substances, which was not explicitly described here."
Employee'S Arm Burned By Flaming Regulator Valve,Employee #1 of h & h plumbing inc. was supervising a plumbing crew that was placing piping in a 3-story wood frame building. One of his crew was using an acetylene torch to solder fittings on 1/2 in. Diameter copper tubing. The regulator on the b-type cylinder started shooting a flame out the side. A crew member ran and got employee #1 to assist in putting out the flame. While attempting to shut off the valve on the acetylene cylinder employee #1 suffered a burn to his arm.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the regulator valve emitting flames (ignition event), which directly caused the burn injury. While the burn involved extreme heat, the root cause was a fire incident, aligning with ""fires and explosion"" samples where ignition (e.g., propane torch igniting gas) precedes burns. ""Exposure to extreme temperatures"" applies to heat transfer without combustion (e.g., steam, hot water), which was not the initiating factor here."
Employee Burned When Vapors From Bonding Adhesive Ignite,On july 30 2007 employee #1 and six coworkers were installing roofing materials including insulation and sheets of rubber membranes on the flat roof of a commercial building. The crew was spreading epdm bonding adhesive from 5-gallon pails to adhere the insulation and rubber sheets together. At one point the vapors from the highly flammable bonding agent ignited in the area where employee #1 was working. He suffered first- and second-degree burns to his right forearm and he was transported to the hospital for treatment. Six to eight of the empty bonding agent containers were left uncovered which allowed vapors to escape that contributed to the main cause of the fire. The ambient temperature was in the high 90s f and the humidity was high. The material safety data sheet and the buckets' labels clearly stated that all containers were to be covered while not in use and that vapors from the bonding agent could be readily ignited by static electricity.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ignition of flammable vapors released from uncovered containers, which directly caused the burns. While the release of vapors (exposure to chemicals) preceded the fire, the definition of ""exposure to chemical substances"" requires contact with toxic/corrosive substances, whereas the harm here resulted from thermal burns via combustion. The ignition aligns with ""fires and explosion"" as the decisive uncontrolled event per the principle of labeling the first action directly triggering injury."
Employee Is Burned In Flammable Liquid Fire,At approximately 11:46 a.m. on october 16 2008 employee #1 a construction laborer-leadman worked for a residential and commercial construction company. His supervisor provided lacquer thinner and cloth rags to him and his coworkers instructing them to clean paint and adhesive from the floor of a janitor's closet. They were not trained on the safe use and hazards of working with lacquer thinner or flammable liquids. They were working in the room on their hands and knees applying the lacquer thinner to the floor using cloth rags. A coworker closest to the door and the water heater yelled fire and ran out of the room. Employee #1 stood up and turned around observed that the room was on fire and ran for the door. He fell near the water heater stood up and ran out of the room with his clothes on fire. His coworkers extinguished the fire on his clothes and skin. The ceiling sprinkler system eventually put the fire in the room out. Employee #1 was hospitalized with second and third degree burns to his right arm legs and torso.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ignition of flammable lacquer thinner vapors, which directly caused the fire and burns. While unsafe handling of the chemical (exposure risk) preceded the ignition, the critical unintended event triggering harm was the fire itself. The ""fires and explosion"" category captures this initiating action, consistent with similar cases where flammable substance ignition (not mere handling) defines the accident cause."
Maintenance Worker Catches On Fire While Arc Cutting,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on november 6 2012 employee #1 a 35-year-old male temporary worker with mcm construction inc. was working at a construction site in long beach california. Employee #1 was attempting to remove and replace a broken tooth on the digging bucket at the maintenance yard for the schuyler helm bridge replacement project. Employee #1 was performing repair on the shanks clamp pocket by using air arc to cut old metal off to put on a new pocket. Prior to this task employee #1 had worked on a hydraulic valve at different location about a five- minute drive from the construction site. After the hydraulic valve task was completed employee #1 did not put the flammable solvent-tech brake parts cleaner- bucket away before starting the cutting grinding and welding task. Employee #1 kept the plastic bucket and some dirty rags at the work-bench on the back of the truck. The work-bench was about 3 ft. above the ground and 10 ft. away from the cutting area. The grinding and cutting area was about 5 ft. above the ground. While employee #1 was using an air arc to cut the old metal off the pocket some sparks caught rags on fire behind the truck. Employee #1 pulled the rags underneath the bucket to put down the fire. The solvent splashed on his upper body and caught him on fire. Employee #1 suffered second and third degree burns to 40-percent of his upper body. Employee #1 was transported to st. mary long beach hospital and later was transferred to ucla burn center where he was hospitalized and treated for three and a half weeks.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action directly causing injury was the ignition of solvent-soaked rags by arc-cutting sparks, resulting in fire. While improper chemical storage contributed to the hazard, the immediate harm stemmed from combustion (flames), not direct chemical contact. This aligns with ""fires and explosion"" samples where ignition sources (e.g., welding sparks) triggered burns, even when flammable materials were present. ""Exposure to chemical substances"" requires harm via toxic/corrosive contact (e.g., splashes, inhalation), which occurred only after the fire started. The principle prioritizes the initiating hazardous event (fire), not preconditions."
Employee Suffers Burns When Caught In Flash Fire,At approximately 9:30 a.m. on september 3 2013 employee # 1 was heating hot asphalt oil spray wand using a propane torch. During the heating of spray wand a coworker attempted to reposition the wand and accidentally pressed the nozzle control handle that blow out hot oil and diesel. A flash fire occurred and caught employee #1's clothing on fire. The coworker responded to the accident and drove the employee to an area hospital where he was treated for second degree burns to his neck and arms. Employee #1 remained hospitalized.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the coworker accidentally pressing the nozzle control handle, which directly triggered the **release of hot oil and diesel** (extreme-temperature substances). However, the burns resulted from the **flash fire** caused by ignition of these substances, not from direct contact with the hot oil/diesel itself. While the release of hot materials preceded ignition, the **immediate cause of injury** (fire) aligns with ""fires and explosion."" The ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" category typically applies to burns from direct contact with hot substances (e.g., splashed asphalt) without combustion. Here, the fire was the uncontrolled action that directly harmed the employee."
Employees Injured During Explosion,Employee #1 was part of a two man crew working at a house removing linoleum tile. The room that crew was working in did not have heat so they brought a heater and a fan to warm up the area. They were using acetone on the tile when an explosion occurred. Employee #1 suffered burns to his body and was hospitalized.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the ignition of acetone vapors due to the presence of a heater/fan in an enclosed space, which directly caused the explosion. While acetone is a chemical, the accident��s root cause was combustion triggered by improper environmental conditions (heat source + flammable vapors), aligning with ""fires and explosion"" samples where volatile substances ignited. ""Exposure to chemical substances"" typically involves direct toxic/corrosive contact (e.g., spills, leaks), whereas here the chemical��s flammability��not its toxicity��drove the accident sequence."
Employee Suffers Burns To Arm And Leg When Fuel Ignites,On april 9 2013 employee #1 a brick tender was using a stihl cut-off saw to cut rebar. The employee filled the saw with gasoline and replaced the cap. Fuel leaked from the stihl cut-off saw and a spark ignited the leaked fuel. The employee was burned on his left arm and leg. The employee was transported to the sutter hospital by coworkers and was then transferred to uc davis burn unit where he was treated for the burns. Employee #1 remained hospitalized for ten days.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the fuel leak, but the injury mechanism (burns) directly resulted from combustion triggered by ignition, not from chemical toxicity or corrosion. While gasoline is a chemical, the harm aligns with ""fires and explosion"" samples where fuel spills ignited (e.g., spilled gasoline ignited by sparks/hot engines). ""Exposure to chemical substances"" requires harm via direct chemical contact (e.g., chemical burns), which did not occur here. The principle prioritizes the initial action leading to harm, which was ignition, not passive leakage."
Employee Is Injuried When Burned In Underground Fire,At 8:00 a.m. on december 14 2010 employee #1 a welder set up welding equipment on a construction worksite located on a public residential road in montebello california. Employee #1 set up the welding equipment inside a 30 in. Concrete line steel pipe located 12 ft below grade. An overnight accumulation of methane was probably present in the soils of montebello due to abandoned oil and gas wells in the area. Preentry purging of the air and air monitoring within the confined space was not conducted. The shield metal arc welding equipment sparked. The spark ignited flammable gases and caused a flash fire in the pipe. Employee #1 received second and third degree burns from the fire. Employee #1 was hospitalized for more than 24 hours and treated for his burns. That same day cal/osha received a report of the accident.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The first uncontrolled action directly triggering the accident was the welding spark igniting accumulated methane, which caused the flash fire. While methane accumulation (due to inadequate purging) created hazardous conditions, the **initial unintended action** was the ignition event. ""Fires and explosion"" aligns with the direct cause of injury (thermal burns from fire), whereas methane��s role as a flammable gas relates to fire risk, not chemical toxicity or corrosive exposure. The similar ""fires and explosion"" samples confirm that ignition sources (e.g., welding sparks) leading to burns are core to this category, even when hazardous gases are present."
Employee Burned When Vapors Ignite,At approximately 3:00 p.m. on may 8 2000 employee #1 a leadman for a waterproofing contractor was working at an apartment building in hollywood ca. He was using an electric chipping gun on a raised portion of the concrete floor after the walls and floor had been cleaned with acetone. A flash fire broke out and employee #1 suffered first- and second-degree burns to his face forearms and hands.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The burns resulted directly from the flash fire ignited by acetone vapors, which aligns with the ""fires and explosion"" class definition of injuries caused by direct fires. While acetone exposure created the flammable environment, the immediate hazardous event triggering the injury was the ignition of vapors (fire), not direct chemical contact (e.g., splashes or skin absorption). The ""fires and explosion"" samples similarly prioritize ignition events (gasoline spark, spray foam fire) over precursor chemical presence."
Employee Dies Of Acute Pulmonary Edema,After complaining of chest pain for some time employee #1 collapsed and died while digging a shallow hole in a petroleum fuel booster pumping station. The cause of death pulmonary edema was not discovered by pathologists for more than three months following the death. Toxicology tests were negative.,others,others,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the employee��s collapse due to acute pulmonary edema, a medical condition not definitively linked to chemical exposure. Toxicology tests were negative, and no direct evidence (e.g., detected fumes, confirmed inhalation) ties the death to chemical substances. While the petroleum environment introduces ambiguity, the ""others"" category aligns with cases where natural causes or unverified work-related factors (despite environmental context) are primary, as seen in similar samples involving undetected/natural fatalities."
Employee Falls From Elevation  Sustains Minor Injuries,Employee #1 was disassembling a concrete form for a vertical column which had the rebar already in position. Employee #1 climbed the column while tied off to one of the anchor points with a retractable braking line attached to a full body harness. Employee #1 proceeded to disconnect the former braces and when one fell it released the portion where employee #1 had tied off. It began to fall pulling him off the structure. Employee #1 fell approximately 20 ft to the ground sustaining serious but not permanent contusions sprains and abrasions. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was treated and released.,collapse of object,others,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the structural failure of the formwork system when a brace fell, releasing the anchor point and causing the structure to collapse. This structural failure directly preceded and triggered the fall. While the fall resulted in injury, the root cause aligns with ""collapse of object"" due to the initial structural failure, consistent with its definition and similar cases where anchor/system failures (e.g., boatswain’s chair descent device failure, bracket-induced ladder collapse) are classified as structural collapses. The ""falls"" category applies when no structural failure precedes the fall (e.g., slips, unsecured movement), which is secondary here."
Roofing Worker Dies After Cerebral Hemorrhage,On june 26 2012 employee #1 and coworkers of crown corr inc. a gary in roofing siding and sheet metal work contractor were working on the roof of the nearly completed supplemental smof/submarine facility at newport news shipyard in virginia. Employee #1 began feeling ill. He was taken down from the roof to be treated by the shipyard's emergency medical service. He was transported to riverside regional medical center and admitted to the intensive care unit having suffered an apparent stroke. Employee #1 died at riverside hospital on june 29 2012 after removal from life support. No autopsy was conducted. This was classified as a natural causes death with reference to the death certificate which listed cause of death as intracranial hemorrhage caused by hypertension. The death was not related to a virginia (vosh) standard.,others,others,正确,"The text explicitly attributes the fatality to a cerebral hemorrhage caused by hypertension, classified as a natural cause unrelated to workplace hazards. While the worker was on a roof (a potential high-heat environment), no evidence of extreme temperature exposure (e.g., heat stress, hyperthermia) or environmental conditions contributing to the medical event exists in the narrative. The ""exposure to extreme temperatures"" samples require direct causal links to temperature extremes (e.g., heat stroke, hyperthermia), which are absent here. The first uncontrolled action is the internal medical event (hemorrhage), aligning with ""others"" as defined by non-work-related natural causes."
Employee Dies Of Legionnaires' Disease,On november 29 1995 employee #1 died of pneumonia after burning steel trusses. Legionella bacteria were found in the employee's urine but he had not been in good health and there was no indication that his immune system made any attempt to fight off the legionnaires' disease. The source of the bacteria could not be established and a connection to the work place could not be made.,others,others,正确,"The text explicitly states no confirmed workplace connection to Legionella bacteria exposure, and the disease itself is biological rather than chemical. While burning steel trusses might suggest potential fume exposure, the fatal outcome stemmed from an unverified biological agent (Legionella) unrelated to chemical substances. The ""others"" category accommodates unconfirmed biological/environmental exposures (e.g., valley fever analogy) and natural-cause deaths, aligning with the principle of labeling only the first uncontrolled action. Here, the unresolved biological exposure precedes any implied chemical risk, making ""others"" the correct classification."
Telecommunication Worker Is Killed In Fall From Aerial Lift,On july 23 2012 employee #1 and two coworkers were installing a guy for a utilility pole across the intersection of central avenue pike and beaver creek lane in knoxville tennessee. One coworker was a flagger and the other was a lineman. The flagger was out on central avenue pike to control traffic on central avenue pike before a section of cable was laid across the intersection. Employee #1 used an aerial lift to attach one end of the guy to the utility pole on the west side of central avenue pike. Employee #1 boomed down and the truck was moved to another utility pole on beaver creek lane. The crew made sure that there was enough slack in the cable so that the cable would lie flat across the intersection. Employee #1 raised the bucket to an estimated height of 15 feet (4.6 meters) in order to hang the guy on the utility pole. At that point employee #1 saw that he had connected the guy on the south side of a fiber optic cable that was installed diagonally across beaver creek lane when it needed to be on the north side. Employee #1 boomed down and asked the lineman to hand him the cable. Employee #1 had the flagger put down the flagging sign come over to the bucket truck cut the cable from the reel and hand it to him. The flagger left the roadway walked across the street and cut the cable using a pair of bolt cutters. Employee #1 had the cable in his hand but not the end of the cable. He was going try to get it over the fiber optic cable line. Employee #1 boomed up to an estimated height of 20 feet (6.1 meters) and jerked the cable up which reduced the slack in the cable that was supposed to be lying flat across central avenue pike. Before the flagger or lineman could get back to the roadway they heard noises. A pickup truck traveling southbound on central avenue pike drove over the cable and the cable became caught in its rear bumper. The lineman took off running to an open field but he was hit in the back by the cable 5 or 6 times. Employee #1 who was not wearing a harness or lanyard fell approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) to the ground. The coworkers came over to the bucket truck and saw employee #1 lying on the ground. The lineman called emergency medical services and local law enforcement and first responders arrived. Employee #1 was transported to the university of tennessee medical center in knoxville tn. He had been killed.,falls,others,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was Employee #1 falling from the aerial lift due to lack of a harness/lanyard. While the pickup truck’s interaction with the cable triggered the sequence, the fatal injury resulted directly from the fall, which occurred independently after the cable became taut. The ""falls"" category captures the initial unintended action (falling from elevation) that directly caused the fatality, whereas ""traffic"" describes a secondary vehicular interaction preceding the fall. This aligns with the principle of labeling the first uncontrolled action."
Two Employee Drown In A Lake,On august 11 2004 employee #1 attempted to swim across a small lake. He swam about 45 yards and yelled for help. Employee #2 swam out to help him and both employees drowned.,others,others,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the voluntary decision to swim without adequate safety measures, leading directly to drowning. While entering water overlaps with fall-related cases, there is no evidence of a slip, trip, or fall from elevation.

Worker'S Ankle Is Fractured When Aerial Lift Falls Into Pit,On march 12 2013 employee #1 and coworker #1 electricians employed by an electrical company were working at an aerospace facility. They were in an aerial lift a genie boom z 40/23n model year 2011 serial number z40n11-1428. The lift was elevating them to install electrical conduit at the facility. The lift was situated approximately 1 foot from the edge of a pit that was next to the facility. The pit measured approximately 5 feet to 8 feet deep. The lift moved forward and fell into the pit. Employee #1 was injured. He was transported to the hospital admitted and treated for a fractured ankle. The investigation determined that other employees were working inside the facility. The investigation was unable to determine the circumstances surrounding the lift's moving and falling into the pit.,others,others,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the aerial lift��s unintended forward movement into the pit, which directly triggered the fall. While the injury resulted from a fall, the initiating event (equipment malfunction/motion) aligns with ""others"" samples where machinery dynamics (e.g., unsecured lifts rolling, ropes breaking) drive the accident. The ""falls"" category applies to slips/trips/falls from elevation not caused by equipment failure, whereas here, the root cause is the lift��s operational failure, making ""others"" the correct classification under the first-occurrence principle."
Employee Dies From Mesothelioma,Employee #1 worked in the cable industry for more than 20 years. The employees in this industry drill and pull cable on structures where asbestos-containing building materials or presumed asbestos-containing building materials could be present. No air monitoring or training was conducted for employees performing this type of work. No exposure could be documented for the past six months. Employee #1 died from mesothelioma that is caused from exposure to asbestos.,exposure to chemical substances,others,错误,"The text explicitly attributes the employee’s death to prolonged asbestos exposure (a toxic substance) due to lack of protective measures. While mesothelioma is a long-term outcome, the primary cause is the uncontrolled exposure to asbestos, aligning with the ""exposure to chemical substances"" definition. The ""others"" category applies to cases without direct toxic exposure or where causation is ambiguous, which does not apply here."
Employee Dies From Bee Sting,On september 28 2011 employee #1 was hanging sheetrock in a basement when he was stung by a bee. He was highly allergic to bees and a coworker used an epipen on him but it had no effect. Employee #1 collapsed and emergency medical services (ems) were called. Cpr was begun by a coworker until the ems arrived. Employee #1 was transported to a medical facility where he was pronounced dead.,others,others,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the bee sting, a biological hazard not involving industrial/chemical substances. While venom is toxic, the ""exposure to chemical substances"" category explicitly applies to toxic/corrosive industrial chemicals, not biological agents. The ""others"" category accommodates biological hazards like bee stings, as demonstrated by its similar samples. The fatal reaction stemmed directly from the sting, making ""others"" the correct classification per the principle of labeling the initial unintended action."
Supervisor Is Ejected From Aerial Lift And Killed In Fall,On july 15 2013 employee #1 a work crew supervisor employed by a medical clinic was engaged in exterior carpentry. He was working from a personnel platform attached to the forks of a terex ss-636 turbo square shooter telehandler. The machine rolled backward down a hill and struck a tree. Employee #1 and the personnel platform were ejected from the lift. Employee #1 was killed.,struck by moving objects,others,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the telehandler rolling backward (a moving machine), which directly caused the ejection.

Employee Is Killed When Exposed To Airborne Fungus,On november 15 2011 employee #1 of e-light electrical services in hobbs new mexico was exposed to coccidioides imitis a fungus. This fungus produces spores that can be inhaled when they are airborne. The employee was diagnosed with valley fever which resulted in his death.,others,others,正确,"While fungal spore inhalation shares exposure mechanisms with chemical substances, ""exposure to chemical substances"" explicitly requires contact with toxic/corrosive **chemical agents**. Coccidioides immitis is a biological agent (fungus), not a chemical. The ""others"" category explicitly accommodates biological exposures (e.g., valley fever in its sample pool). The first uncontrolled action��inhaling fungal spores��falls outside defined chemical, structural, or environmental categories, aligning with ""others"" per the classification rules."
Worker Is Injured When Struck By Section Of Guide Rail,On november 30 2009 employee #1 of foundation pile inc. was working on a construction site. While spotting for the pile driver he was struck by a seven-foot section of guide rail which fell off the rig. Employee #1 was hospitalized for fractures to his collarbone left ribs and vertebrae.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the guide rail detaching and falling from the rig, directly striking the worker. This aligns with ""struck by falling object,"" which explicitly addresses injuries caused by objects in free fall. While ""falls"" involves the victim��s own movement (slipping, tripping), here the initiating event was the object��s uncontrolled descent, not structural collapse or the worker��s loss of balance. The similarity to ""struck by falling object"" samples (e.g., falling steel column, tipping bundles) confirms this categorization."
Employee Killed When Rock Falls Into Excavation,Employee #1 and two coworkers were laying a french drain at a private residence. They had excavated under the house to a depth of approximately 7 ft when they encountered a large rock of unknown origin. The rock fell crushing and killing employee #1.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The accident��s first uncontrolled action was the rock falling freely from an elevated position during excavation, not due to structural failure (e.g., trench wall collapse). While excavation instability might be inferred, the text explicitly describes a discrete falling object (""rock fell"") rather than structural collapse. The ""struck by falling object"" category aligns with this mechanism, as seen in similar samples where objects (e.g., slabs, buckets) fell independently of structural failure. ""Collapse of object"" requires structural/systemic failure (e.g., trench walls, foundations), which is not explicitly stated here."
Employee Bruised When Struck By Falling Rock,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on september 1 1995 employee #1 was working on a sloped embankment at the side of highway 101. A ditch digging machine above him was being used by another employer to dig a trench. An 8 in. Diameter boulder fell and struck employee #1 on the head and neck bruising him. He was taken to the hospital for a check-up and then released.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The boulder��s dislodgement occurred during trenching activity without explicit evidence of structural failure (e.g., embankment collapse or instability). The first uncontrolled action was the boulder��s fall due to excavation forces, akin to ""struck by falling object"" samples where objects fell due to equipment/activity (e.g., crane rigging failure, unsteady stacks). ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the root cause (e.g., trench walls, bridges), which is not definitively established here. The accident aligns with the principle of labeling the initial unintended action (boulder falling) rather than inferred structural collapse."
Employee Injured When Struck By Falling Section Of Manhole,On october 11 2004 employee #1 was performing his regular duties when he was satruck by a precast section of concrete manhole that fell from a caterpillar it24f integrated tool carrier. He sustained multiple fractures for which he was hsopitalized.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The accident describes a precast manhole section falling from equipment (Caterpillar tool carrier) during handling, with no evidence of structural failure of the manhole itself or its supporting structure. The uncontrolled action was the object becoming dislodged and falling freely, consistent with ""struck by falling object"" samples (e.g., crane boom sections, detached buckets). While ""collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event, this incident aligns with objects falling due to handling/equipment operation, not structural instability. The first unintended action was the object��s dislodgement, not a collapse."
Construction Employee Killed By Falling Crane Boom,On april 17 2003 employees of walsh construction co. were removing pins from the jib section of a crane boom. Employee #1 was standing under the boom while removing the bottom pins. The boom fell and employee #1 was struck and pinned to the ground. He died of fractures.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the removal of the crane boom pins, which directly caused the boom to fall freely (not due to structural failure). While the event resembles structural collapse, the root cause was procedural (pin removal), making the boom a falling object under worker control. The ""struck by falling object"" category explicitly addresses objects falling from height due to non-structural causes, aligning with the pin-removal-triggered fall described."
Employee Struck By Bar Joist,On december 9 1998 employee #1 an iron worker for a structural steel erector working at a movie theater construction site was struck by one of four bar joists (approximately 50 ft long by 2 ft tall) that fell about 30 ft from the roof installation. The joists about 6-ft center did not have bridging installed between them to resist the lateral movement caused by a load was placed on them by a crane. This oversight caused the joists to tip and fall when two bundles of decking were placed upon them. Employee #1 was hospitalized for his injuries.,collapse of object,struck by falling object,错误,"The accident was triggered by structural failure (lack of bridging between joists), which caused them to tip and fall under the crane’s load. This aligns with ""collapse of object"" as the initiating event was a structural instability, not an external object falling independently. The joists’ collapse directly resulted from improper installation, prioritizing structural failure over the secondary ""struck by"" consequence."
Worker Is Killed While Installing Helical Piles At Jobsite,On october 21 2008 employee #1 a laborer and a coworker a bobcat equipment operator of advanced foundations systems inc. were installing helical piles to support the foundation of a new building. The coworker attached hydraulic lines and pushed the leaver activating the bottom wedge and employee #1 activated the right lever for the respective bottom wedge to secure the bob tach frame apparatus to the bobcat. The coworker drove the model 864 bobcat to the location of the site where the helical piles were to be driven into the ground. The site was 80x60 inch hole about 3 feet deep. Employee #1 entered the site and placed the pile into position. As the bob tach apparatus was raised into position it fell onto employee #1 from a height of approximately 7 feet. The total weight of the attached apparatus was between 900 and 1 000 pounds.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The apparatus fell from a height of 7 feet due to an uncontrolled release during positioning, not due to structural failure of a permanent installation or worksite. The incident aligns with ""struck by falling object"" as the apparatus functioned as an unsecured load (not part of a structural system), mirroring cases like the compactor falling off equipment. While the installation context might suggest structural instability, the first unintended action was the apparatus detaching/falling, not a structural collapse of the foundation or installed components."
Worker Is Struck And Killed By Falling Steel Beam,On march 8 2013 a construction laborer employed by mcm carpentry was working at a single family home construction site. He was crouched down in the basement while constructing a wall frame. High winds toppled one of several steel i-beams installed on top of the foundation wall. As the steel beam fell it struck the employee on the back of his head and neck killing him.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the steel beam falling due to high winds, an external force, rather than structural failure of the beam or its installation. While the beam was installed on the foundation, there is no evidence of structural degradation (e.g., weld failure, corrosion, or design flaws) causing its collapse. The beam��s fall resulted from environmental force (wind), making it a free-falling object striking the worker. This matches ""struck by falling object"" samples (e.g., unsteady beams falling due to rigging failure or external forces), whereas ""collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event."
Employee Breaks Leg When Struck By Falling Mailbox,On october 20 2010 a mailbox with a brick base was being hoisted using a small trackhoe with the bucket attached. The mailbox base was suspended by 2 nylon slings connected to a tooth of the bucket. One of the slings which were attached to the middle tooth of the bucket slipped off and the brick mailbox base weighing about 800 pounds struck employee #1 breaking his leg.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the sling slipping off the bucket tooth, causing the mailbox base to fall freely. While the sling failure could be interpreted as a rigging issue, ""collapse of object"" requires structural failure (e.g., breaking components like hoisting lines or scaffold brackets). Here, the sling did not structurally fail but slipped due to improper attachment, aligning with ""struck by falling object"" where objects fall from height without structural collapse. The samples for ""struck by"" include similar equipment-related failures (e.g., bucket twisting off a bracket), whereas ""collapse"" samples involve structural integrity breaches."
Demolition Worker Is Fatally Crushed By Falling Concrete,On september 10 2013 employee #1 and coworker #1 employed by a heavy construction contractor specializing in demolition and other site preparation were engaged in demolishing a commercial building. The building's structure consisted of concrete floors columns panels and metal beams. The building had three stories with a total height of 69 feet. The two workers were operating excavators to demolish columns and bays and drop them to the ground. On the previous day they had left an overhang of concrete from three bays. On the morning of september 10 2013 coworker #1 continued to demolish columns while employee #1 used his excavator to break up concrete on the ground. Coworker #1 used his excavator to pull down a column. The overhanging concrete fell to the ground crushing employee #1 and killing him. This fatality was investigated by minnesota osha. At the time of this report mnosha had proposed three serious citations for the employer and no citations for the general contractor.,collapse of object,struck by falling object,错误,"The overhanging concrete fell due to structural destabilization caused by active demolition work (pulling down a column), which aligns with ""collapse of object"" as the initiating event was structural failure during demolition. While the concrete struck the worker, the root cause was the collapse sequence triggered by demolition, distinguishing it from external objects falling independently (e.g., tools or materials dislodged without structural failure)."
Employee Is Injured By Falling Door   Later Dies,On june 10 2011 employee # 1 was working for d.c.g. Peterson brothers inc. performing framing duties to a new dry mineral storage building located in manson iowa. Five employees were engaged in building custom heavy wood frame doors. The doors were made of 2 by10 wood materials being placed between sheets of 0.5 inch plywood. The door was approximately 9 feet 5 inches tall by 16 feet wide weighing approximately 1 000 to 3 000 pounds. The bottom of the door contains two pieces of angle iron approximately 3 inches by 3 inches 0.25 inch thick and 10 feet in length. Employee # 1 and his crew attempted to move the door to an upright position by wrapping a synthetic or nylon strap around the frame with the other end of the strap attached to one fork of a caterpillar telehandler model number # th103. Employee # 2 operated the telehandler to raise the door up off the floor to the upright position. The door was at an angle of approximately 75 degrees when employee # 1 grabbed a broom and began to sweep underneath the door. The strap slid off the fork of the telehandler and struck employee # 1 on his lower back. Employee # 1 fell to the ground in extreme pain. Rescue service transported employee # 1 to a local hospital who was later transported to iowa methodist hospital in des moines the same day. Employee # 1 underwent surgery to correct a fractured pelvis and a fractured lower left leg. Employee # 1 was transported to iowa lutheran hospital to begin physical therapy after the surgeries. Employee # 1 later died from respiratory complications as well as an infection.,struck by falling object,struck by falling object,正确,"The strap and door fell due to gravity after slipping off the telehandler fork, making the incident a free-fall event. While the telehandler was moving, the strap��s release was uncontrolled and not propelled horizontally. The primary cause aligns with ""struck by falling object,"" as the strap/door fell independently after detachment, consistent with similar samples (e.g., a brace tipping from a cart). The dynamic sliding of the strap is secondary to the gravitational fall, adhering to the ""first occurrence of uncontrolled action"" principle."
Loose Nail Falls And Lodges In Carpenter'S Eye,On april 9 2007 employee #1 was working as an exterior carpenter for a carpentry contractor. He was using a hammer to tack down ccx plywood on the soffit portion of the roof sheeting. As he was setting the nail it came loose and struck him in the eye lodging there. He was hospitalized for treatment for the foreign body in his eye.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The nail became a projectile due to direct hammering force during tool use (uncontrolled action), not free fall under gravity. While the nail ""came loose,"" its motion originated from the hammer strike, aligning with ""struck by moving objects"" (propelled by tool energy). The ""struck by falling object"" category requires an object falling solely due to gravity after dislodgement, which does not apply here as the nail��s trajectory was directly tied to the hammering action."
Employee Injured In Blasting Accident,"At approximately 2:15 p.m. on july 11 2002 employee #1 and other coworkers were waiting outside of the designated ""safety zone"" for a quarry production blast. The employees were between a metal storage rack and parked pick-up truck next to a portable trailer. At this point it was approximately 1 100 ft from the face of the shot. The expected ""safety zone"" was approximately 800 ft. no equipment was involved in this accident. The flying rock from the blast flew farther than expected. Employee #1 was struck by some flying rock and sustained contusions to the back a fractured rig a collapsed lung and later it was necessary to remove both kidneys. Employee #1 was hospitalized.",struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The primary cause of the injury was the flying rock propelled by the blast, not the explosion itself. While the blast initiated the event, the injury resulted from a moving object (rock) striking the employee, aligning with ""struck by moving objects"" (objects in motion causing harm). The ""fires and explosion"" category requires direct injury from flames, heat, or blast pressure, which is not described here. The similar ""struck by moving objects"" samples (e.g., flying chain, rock kicked up by machinery) reinforce this classification, as they involve secondary projectiles from an initiating force. The explosion was the root cause of the rock��s motion, but the injury mechanism matches the definition of ""struck by moving objects."""
Demolition Laborer Fractures Skull When Struck In Head,On february 18 2014 employee #1 a 50-year-old male demolition laborer with deconstruction services llc was picking up roof rafter material that was thrown from the third floor deck of a building when he was struck in the back of the head with such material sustaining a skull fracture and several lacerations. Employee #1 was transported to university shock trauma where he remained until march 8 2013.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The material was actively thrown from the third floor, imparting horizontal force to its motion. While it fell from height, the first uncontrolled action was the intentional propulsion (throwing), aligning with ""struck by moving objects"" (objects in motion not in free fall). The ""thrown"" action distinguishes it from passive falling due to gravity, as seen in ""struck by falling object"" cases where objects drop due to instability or failed support."
Employee Partially Amputates Thumb With Circular Saw,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on november 7 2013 employee #1 was working on the construction site of a residential building. His duties involved framing the building which included operating a powered portable circular saw (skilsaw mag 77-75 serial number 203 002504) and cutting boards. Employee #1 was rip-cutting a board to create a notch in it. He was holding a 2 in. By 6 in. Piece of lumber in his unsupported left hand and holding the saw with only his right hand. When employee #1 made the rip cut into the lumber the saw rapidly jumped out of the cut causing him to lose control of the saw. The saw blade made contact with his left hand resulting in a partial amputation of his left thumb. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center where he was treated for the partial amputation and was then hospitalized.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the circular saw ""jumping out of the cut"" (kickback), which directly caused the blade to strike the worker��s hand. While the injury involved contact with the blade, the initiating event was the saw��s uncontrolled motion, aligning with ""struck by moving objects"" definitions (e.g., tool kickback incidents in similar samples). ""Caught in/between objects"" typically requires entanglement or crushing between two objects, which is not the primary mechanism here. The accident sequence prioritizes the tool��s unintended movement over blade-hand interaction as the root cause."
Employee Killed Between Backhoe Boom And Outrigger,On july 1 2007 employee #1 a backhoe operator was placing a tool on the floor of the operator's compartment. The tool struck the boom's swing mechanism causing the boom to come down. Employee #1 became caught between it and one of the backhoe's outriggers. He was crushed and killed.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the tool striking the boom��s swing mechanism, which directly caused the boom to move (a moving object). While the fatal injury resulted from compression between the boom and outrigger, the triggering event was the unintended motion of the boom.

Employee Is Injured By Saw While Jumping From Ladder,On august 11 2006 employee #1 was on an 8 ft step ladder using a circular saw on an eave. When he disturbed a yellow jacket nest he jumped off the ladder and tried to throw the saw away. The saw blade struck employee #1's right abdominal area. He was hospitalized for a deep abdominal laceration.,falls,struck by moving objects,错误,"The initiating event was the employee jumping off the ladder (a fall from elevation) to avoid the yellow jacket nest. While the saw struck the employee, its motion was a secondary consequence of the fall. The accident hierarchy prioritizes the first uncontrolled action (the jump/fall) as the primary cause, consistent with similar ""falls"" samples where injuries occurred after falling from elevation, even if objects were involved post-fall."
Employee Amputates Fingertip In Fan Belt,At about 10:20 a.m. on august 14 2012 employee #1 with johnson controls inc. was conducting an inspection on a marine laboratory air handler system located at the basement of the building. Employee #1 turned off the power of the fan and removed the top panel cover. During the inspection he moved around and his hand hit the rotating drive belt of the exhaust fan which resulted in a right thumb injury. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital. Employee #1 suffered from an amputated fingertip.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The injury occurred when the employee��s hand contacted the rotating drive belt, a single moving object in active motion. While ""caught in/between"" implies entrapment between two objects (e.g., machinery components), the accident description specifies direct contact with the belt itself, not pinching between the belt and another object. The rotating belt qualifies as a moving object striking the hand, aligning with the ""struck by moving objects"" definition. The first uncontrolled action was the belt��s motion during inspection, not a secondary entrapment mechanism."
Employee Injured When Struck By Falling Drill Collar,At approximately 8:30 a.m. on september 14 1990 employee #1 a truck driver was watching as a forklift loaded a drill collar onto his truck. As the forks were being removed one of them caught the end of the collar. It rolled off the truck pulling employee #1 with it. He was struck by the drill collar and suffered a fractured right leg and elbow and multiple cuts and bruises. A coworker at the site drove employee #1 to a local hospital.,struck by falling object,struck by moving objects,错误,"The drill collar became a free-falling object after rolling off the truck’s elevated platform due to gravitational force, striking the victim. While the forklift’s mechanical action initiated movement, the accident’s primary cause was the uncontrolled fall of the collar (a free-falling object), aligning with the ""struck by falling object"" definition. The forklift’s role was indirect, whereas the collar’s fall directly caused the injury, ruling out ""struck by moving objects"" (which involves objects in controlled motion, not free fall)."
Employee Fractures Hand When Whipped By Plaster Hose,At about 3:15 p.m. on september 26 2013 employee #1 with dcs plastering inc. was working from a scaffold while two coworkers were in the process of disconnecting blocked plaster hoses. First one coworker opened the side locking levers of the coupling that jointed two hoses together while the other coworker tapped the coupling with a hammer. Second employee #1 slowly separated the hose by pulling it. As the hose was separating the pressurized hose whipped; it struck employee #1's hand. The contributing factors were pressurized hoses were not completely released prior to disconnecting and no specific procedures existed for disconnecting pressurized hoses for cleaning/unclogging operations. Employee #1 was hospitalized with a fractured right hand.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the pressurized hose whipping violently during disconnection, which directly struck the employee��s hand. This aligns with ""struck by moving objects"" (a pressurized object in motion causing injury) rather than a ""caught in/between"" scenario (entrapment between two objects or machinery components). The similarity samples for ""struck by moving objects"" consistently involve pressurized components releasing energy to propel objects (e.g., nozzles, pipe caps, valves), matching the hose��s abrupt movement. While disconnection procedures could suggest machinery interaction, the injury mechanism here was purely impact from a moving hose, not compression or entrapment."
Employee Killed When Pinned By Crane Counterweight,At approximately 1:40 p.m. on june 24 1997 employee #1 was returning to the back of a crane after getting a drink from a water jug situated on the front of the crane. He was struck by the counterweight and became pinned against the concrete barrier separating two lanes of traffic. Employee #1 was killed instantly.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the crane��s counterweight actively moving and striking the victim, which directly aligns with the ""struck by moving objects"" definition (non-free-falling mechanical motion).

Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Backhoe Boom,On february 14 2005 employee #1 had dismounted a backhoe with the engine running and the boom in the upraised position. He retrieved a pneumatic chipping hammer from a nearby toolbox and put it in the rear left side of the cab. The pneumatic chipping hammer weighed approximately 35-40 pounds and was placed on top of the left swing pedal. This activated the boom causing it to move to the left pinning employee #1 against the upraised stabilizer. A nearby heavy equipment operator used the backhoe controls to move the boom to the right to free employee #1. Employee #1 died.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the pneumatic chipping hammer activating the boom's swing pedal, causing the boom to move unexpectedly. While the worker was ultimately pinned between the boom and stabilizer (entrapment), the initiating event aligns with ""struck by moving objects"" as defined by the unintended movement of the boom itself. This matches the Top-1 ""struck by"" sample (similarity=0.778) where equipment placement triggered boom motion, prioritizing the moving object's action over the entrapment consequence."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Steel Pipe,On may 8 2012 a trackhoe operator was pulling a 5-inch steel pipe and a 10-inch diameter steel pipe from a debris pile to place them in a cleared area. The 5-inch pipe was approximately 70-feet in length and the 10-inch pipe was 50-feet in length. The trackhoe operator met resistance as he pulled the pipes. When the pipes released the 5-inch pipe swung outward striking employee #1 in the head as he walked around the corner of building and killed him.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the 5-inch pipe swinging outward due to tension release during machinery operation. While the pipe��s motion followed dislodging from debris, it was propelled by mechanical force (trackhoe operation), not gravity-driven free fall. This aligns with ""struck by moving objects"" (e.g., pressurized pipe cap blowout, boom swing from control lever contact) where motion originates from active forces, not passive falling. ""Struck by falling object"" requires free-fall trajectory from height, which is not described here."
Employee Suffers Contusions In Fall From Beam,"At approximately 1:06 p.m. on january 21 2008 employee #1 was working at the construction site of a new four-story steel-framed parking structure in los angeles ca. At the time of the accident the construction was at the second level. Employee #1 and another ironworker were standing on a 14 ft 7 in. High beam to connect another beam. As that beam was swung in employee #1 was knocked off balance and began to fall. He was wearing an appropriate fall protection harness that was tied to a moveable beam clamp. The beams in the structure have waists cut into their end points for stress relief that the workers refer to as ""dog bones"". Because they are narrower at this point the beam clamps can slide off them. This is what happened when employee #1 lost his balance. The clamp came off and as he fell he first grabbed onto the beam to slow his descent. He landed feet first and was transported to the hospital as a precautionary measure. Employee #1 suffered minor contusions and was released after approximately 4 hours. After the accident the employer decided to use chokers in place of beam clamps.",struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the beam being actively swung into position, which directly knocked the employee off balance. While the fall occurred due to the clamp failure, the initiating event��being destabilized by the moving beam��aligns with ""struck by moving objects."" This precedes the harness failure and fall, adhering to the principle of labeling the earliest unintended action. The beam��s motion (not free-fall) triggered the sequence, mirroring ""struck by"" samples where moving objects caused imbalance."
Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Backhoe Boom,A approximately 11:30 a.m. on october 15 2003 employee #1 was a non-contract employee of siemers engineering. He and another siemers employee were installing underground water utilities at a new shopping center in san marcos ca. Employee #1 was operating a caterpillar 416c backhoe to dig shallow trenches for pipe. He was qualified as an equipment operator but he was operating the backhoe controls from outside the vehicle. He was found by his foreman with his hands on the control pedals trapped between the hydraulic boom and an outrigger. His chest was crushed and he had been killed. There were no eyewitnesses and it is not known why he was operating the backhoe in this manner.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,错误,"The incident involved the employee being physically compressed between the hydraulic boom and a stationary outrigger, which aligns with the ""caught in/between"" definition of injuries caused by entrapment between two objects. While the boom moved, the primary cause was the pinch-point scenario, not a direct impact from a moving object. Similar samples in ""caught in/between"" (e.g., inadvertent boom activation crushing a worker) reinforce this classification."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Exploding Boiler,On january 22 2009 employee #1 of bp construction was thawing a frozen sewer line. The steamer (boiler) exploded and employee #1 was struck and killed by the steamer.,fires and explosion,struck by moving objects,错误,"The initiating event was the boiler explosion, which directly caused the fatal injury. While debris from the explosion struck the worker, the accident began with an uncontrolled explosion (a primary cause under ""fires and explosion""), not a pre-existing moving object.

Employee Fractures Leg When Struck By Steel Frame,At approximately 9:00 a.m. on july 1 2013 employee #1 was removing equipment from a bore pit excavation measuring approximately 37 ft long 13.5 ft wide and 24 ft deep. After using a crane to remove the auger boring machine and an approximately 10 ft section of the steel jacking frame the next step was to lift the roughly 21 ft long 6 ft wide and 21 in. Tall weighing 15 400 lbs. Rear section of the jacking frame a couple feet off of the ground and move it to the front of the excavation where it could be lifted out. The employee attached 2 wire rope slings with hooks to picking holes on either side and at about the halfway point of the frame and stood approximately 3 ft between the frame and the steel slide rail type shoring system. Employee #1 signaled the crane operator to hoist up. The employee walked to the front of the frame as it was being lifted reaching the front right corner of the frame and noticed the right rear corner of the frame had become caught in the shoring system. The frame was about 2 ft off of the ground. The employee signaled the crane operator to stop and went around to the left side of the frame bent down to see where it was bound. The frame released on its own and swung toward the employee striking his leg. Employee #1 was transported to an area hospital where he was treated for a fractured right tibia. The employee remains hospitalized.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"While the steel frame was initially caught in the shoring system, the direct cause of injury was the frame��s sudden uncontrolled motion (swinging) after releasing from the entanglement, which struck the employee.

Employee Injured When Struck By Drill Bit,A work crew was drilling underground horizontal bore holes for the installation of fiber-optic cables. An employee assigned to clean the drill bit as it entered one side of an inspection pit in the ground and then exited the other side entered the pit to scrape mud off the bit. The drill bent and flailed around striking the worker's legs and fracturing them. He was hospitalized for his injuries.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the drill bending and flailing, which directly caused the worker to be struck by the moving drill bit. While ""caught in/between objects"" involves entanglement or compression between objects (e.g., rotating machinery trapping limbs), the injury here resulted from a freely moving object (the flailing drill) striking the worker. This aligns with the ""struck by moving objects"" definition, as the drill��s motion��not entanglement or mechanical trapping��was the initial unintended action."
Employee'S Face Is Injured By Flying Object,At approximately 10:30 a.m. on july 29 2005 employee #1 was shaping a 0.25-in. Thick steel bucket with a bosch 1347a portable right-angle grinder (serial number r1880022170). It had no safety guard and its screw-in handle was missing. After trying several new sait 22021 type-27 4.5-in. Wheels that day he selected a wheel comparable to the rated rpm rate of the grinder. He first cut was an approximately 8-in length off the bucket and experienced some wheel binding and jerking problems. His supervisor then explained to him that he needed to cut off more steel on the same bucket and that he needed to cut at an angle to avoid disturbing other components of the grinder. After the supervisor left employee #1 began cutting at an approximately 45-degree angle. The wheel snagged the body of the grinder causing the abrasive wheel to break apart and dislocated from the spindle. Flying debris ejected from the grinder and struck employee #1 in his face. Employee #1 was not wearing a face shield but was wearing ansi labeled safety glasses. The impact of the flying debris upon his face caused two facial lacerations and a broken nose. He was transported to a medical center where he was hospitalized for surgical procedures and postoperative care and then released four days later. Citations issued were a failure to use a grinder guard sound and check the rpm before the wheel was used to receive training for grinder safety and use eye and face protection.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the abrasive wheel breaking apart and becoming a moving projectile due to snagging on the grinder. While equipment misuse (missing guard, improper RPM checks) contributed, the direct cause of injury was the **moving debris** striking the employee��s face. This aligns with ""struck by moving objects"" definitions and similar cases (e.g., grinding discs breaking and striking workers).

Worker'S Leg Is Injured When Struck By Rock During Blasting,"On june 25 2013 employee #1 a heavy equipment mechanic employed by east coast drilling & blasting inc. was working at a construction site for a housing subdivision. His company was blasting rock to excavate building sites. A blast dislodged a piece of rock that struck employee #1. Emergency services were called and employee #1 was transported to the hospital and admitted. It was determined that his leg was severely fractured below the knee. At the time of this report employee #1 was still hospitalized and undergoing numerous surgeries in an attempt to save his leg. The investigation determined that the blast also blew out windows on the excavator. The rock that struck employee #1 was described as ""basketball size.""",struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The rock was propelled by the blast��s explosive force, creating horizontal/radial motion rather than free fall due to gravity. While the rock originated from an elevated position, its movement was directly caused by external energy (blast), aligning with ""struck by moving objects"" (e.g., dynamite explosion propelling rocks in Sample 2 of this category). ""Struck by falling object"" requires uncontrolled descent without propulsion, such as dislodged buckets or slabs (falling under gravity). The first uncontrolled action was the blast-induced motion, not gravitational descent."
Employee Killed When Hit In Head By Piece Of Metal,"At approximately 9:30 a.m. Employee #1 was assisting another employee in a wood shrub/debris cleanup operation. Employee #1 assembled piles of debris and in some cases trimmed the larger pieces at the direction of the excavator operator. The excavator operator would pick up the large piles of wood shrub/debris and drop them into a large tub grinder where they were ground into sawdust. Rocks or other hard objects that could not be ground up were ejected at deadly high velocity forces upwards and out of the tub. Employee #1 was not wearing a ""hart-hat"" even though the work was being done well within a pre-determined hazard zone of operations where the use of a ""hart-hat"" was considered mandatory. According to the excavator operator he saw ""a thing"" eject out of the grinder but did not pay it much attention since this was a common occurrence. Moments later he noticed employee #1 lying on the ground. The operator stopped his machine and went to see what was wrong. The operator saw that employee #1 had a large amount of blood surrounding his head. He looked closer and saw that employee #1 had sustained a massive injury to his head. Employee #1 had sustained severe craniocerebral injuries resulting in his death.",struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the high-velocity ejection of a metal object from the grinder (a propelled, non-free-falling object in motion).

""Others"" does not apply, as the incident explicitly involves a moving object causing injury."
Employee Injured When Struck By Boulder Rolling Into Trench,On october 18 2007 employee #1 was installing a drainage system in a trench when a large boulder rolled into the excavation and struck him on the lower back. He suffered multiple fractures to his hip and pelvis. The trench had no cave-in protection.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The boulder��s motion (rolling into the trench) constitutes horizontal/dynamic movement rather than free fall under gravity.

""Struck by falling object"" requires a free-falling trajectory, which is absent here."
Employee Dies After Being Struck By Pipe And Falling,On february 1 2006 employee #1 was working on a step ladder helping a coworker install temporary lighting. Another employee was working on an aerial lift fastening furring strips to the ceiling prior to the installation of plastic sheeting to seal the area for asbestos removal. The employee in the lift dropped a section of metal pipe (approximately 5.5-ft-long) which then rolled off a sloped concrete roof and struck employee #1. He then fell 8 ft to a concrete floor and sustained internal injuries. Employee #1 was transported to creighton medical center where he was pronounced dead.,struck by falling object,struck by moving objects,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the metal pipe falling from the aerial lift and striking the victim, which directly caused his subsequent fall.

The ""struck by moving objects"" classification applies to non-vehicle-related moving objects, whereas here, the vehicle’s motion was the primary cause."
Skilsaw Blade Jumps And Ampuates Carpenters Finger,On november 14 2013 employee #1 a 33-year-old male journeyman carpenter with torre reich construction was using a skillsaw to cut 1 in. Shims from a 2 in. By 4 in. Board. As employee #1 went to reposition the saw and start a new cut with the saw blade stopped he reached down with his left hand to pull the bottom guard back so he could place the blade directly against the wood. As employee #1 did this he inadvertently squeezed the trigger with his right hand as he lifted up on the saw. The saw blade started spinning and caused the saw to jump. As the saw jumped the spinning blade struck employee #1's left pinky and amputated the tip.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the inadvertent activation of the spinning saw blade (trigger squeeze), which caused the saw to jump and strike the worker��s finger.

Carpenter Sustains Laceration When Saw Kicks Back,On june 17 2013 an employee was working as a fulltime noncontract carpenter for a framing contractor. He was in a scissor lift cutting a piece of plywood with a radial saw such as a skilsaw-type saw when the saw blade bound up and kicked back. The employee sustained a laceration to his left hand that necessitated hospitalization. The division was notified by the employer that same day.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the saw blade binding and kicking back as a moving object, which directly struck the worker��s hand. While blade binding could imply machinery entanglement (caught in/between), the injury mechanism here aligns with ""struck by moving objects"" due to the saw��s abrupt motion causing impact. The similar samples under ""struck by moving objects"" explicitly involve direct contact with moving blades (e.g., chop saws, circular saws) causing lacerations, reinforcing this classification. The binding is the precursor, but the immediate injury-causing action was the blade��s uncontrolled motion striking the hand."
Employee Crushes Fingers While Handling Metal Debris,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on june 23 2009 employee #1 was assisting the owner with water line repair and general clean up at a jobsite located in smith river ca. The owner loaded metal debris into a dump truck with a backhoe while employee #1 covered the load with a tarp. As employee #1 reached into the truck bed to relocate a piece of metal another piece sprung loose from the load and crushed his fingers against the side of the dump truck. He was transported to a medical center where he received treatment and surgery which involved amputating the seriously injured fingers.

Owner Falls From Ladder Due To Electrical Explosion,On june 21 2012 the owner of beco electric co. an electrical contracting company was working on an 8 foot ladder at a commercial building site. The ladder was adjacent to and above an open electrical panel. For unknown reasons a series of 480v 2kamp breakers shorted and exploded. The blast caused the owner to fall onto the concrete floor. He was hospitalized with a head concussion and possible blunt force trauma to the spleen. Cal/osha closed this case due to lack of jurisdiction.,fires and explosion,struck by moving objects,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the electrical explosion caused by the shorted 480V breakers. While the fall resulted in injuries, the explosion itself (an uncontrolled ignition event) directly triggered the accident sequence. ""Fires and explosion"" aligns with the definition of injuries caused by explosions, whereas ""collapse of object"" would require structural failure (e.g., ladder breaking) as the initiating event, which did not occur here. The explosion preceded and caused the fall, adhering to the principle of labeling the first unintended action."
Employee Is Killed By Concrete Panel,On september 9 2009 employee #1 was a truck driver. A precast concrete panel rolled off the truck and killed him.,struck by falling object,struck by moving objects,错误,"The concrete panel rolling off the truck constitutes a freely falling object from a non-structural elevation (the truck bed), with no evidence of structural failure (e.g., truck instability is not equivalent to structural collapse).

Employee In Trench Is Struck And Killed By Bucket Of Backhoe,On august 20 2012 an employee was working for cop wyoming llc a branch of cop construction llc. The narrative did not state his occupation. He was in a trench. The operator of a backhoe was making adjustments to the placement of a trench box in the trench and the employee was struck by the bucket of the backhoe. Initial information suggested that the bucket was located over the box from one end to the other and that the bucket slipped off the spreader bar. According to this initial information the bucket struck the employee in the head as he was standing beneath the bucket and arm of the backhoe. He sustained a fracture and he was killed.,struck by moving objects,struck by moving objects,正确,"The bucket was actively being adjusted by the operator as part of the backhoe��s controlled motion when it slipped off the spreader bar.

While occurring on-site, the incident aligns with ""traffic"" (vehicle-related injuries during work-driven movement) rather than ""others,"" which addresses non-vehicular equipment misuse or atypical accidents. The overturn during active driving mirrors ""traffic"" samples involving work vehicles in motion (e.g., trucks backing up, utility vehicles rolling over)."
Employee Is Struck And Killed By Truck,At approximately 1:30 a.m. on august 6 2011 employee #1 a flagger was directing traffic and wearing the appropriate personal protective equipment. Available lighting traffic signs and cones had been setup at the worksite where the northbound traffic was diverted into the southbound lane. As she directed traffic a pickup truck was traveling southbound and failed to stop. When the last vehicle traveling northbound moved over the pickup truck swerved and struck her. Employee #1 died from traumatic injuries from the collision. The pickup fled the scene and continued southbound and was stopped by the county sheriff department. The driver of the truck tested positive for alcohol and was arrested.,traffic,traffic,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the pickup truck driver��s failure to stop in a traffic-controlled work zone, directly violating traffic safety protocols. While the victim was struck by a moving object (the truck), this occurred within a roadway work zone context where traffic flow management was the primary hazard. The accident sequence aligns with ""traffic"" category samples (e.g., vehicles entering work zones, drivers failing to heed warnings) rather than isolated ""struck by moving objects"" incidents (e.g., equipment chains snapping, flying debris). The driver��s impaired operation (alcohol) and fleeing behavior further reinforce the traffic-specific nature of the initiating action."
Employee Is Pinned Between Skidder And Bridge And Is Killed,On july 30 2013 employee #1 was operating a ditchwitch sk350 rubber tracked skid steer with a loader bucket attachment to grade dirt underneath a bridge. As the loaded bucket was raised and the skid steer was in motion the front end of the skid steer tipped forward and the back end went up. Employee #1 was standing on the skid steer's stand-on platform and had approximately 4.67 ft of space to stand upright. He became pinned between the controls panel on the skidder and the bridge when the skid steers back end lifted. Employee #1 sustained traumatic crushing injuries and died.,caught in/between objects,traffic,错误,"The first uncontrolled action was the skid steer’s unintended tipping motion during operation (raising the loaded bucket while moving), which directly caused the worker to be compressed between the controls panel and the bridge. While the tipping motion resembles equipment instability, there is no evidence of structural failure (e.g., platform collapse, machine component disintegration). The accident sequence aligns with ""caught in/between objects"" as the worker was trapped between two objects (machine and bridge) during operational movement, consistent with the category’s definition and similar samples (e.g., being caught between machinery buckets). ""Collapse of object"" requires structural failure as the initiating event, which is absent here."
Employee Killed When Run Over By Backing Dump Truck,On october 11 2007 employee #1 a foreman was walking behind a backing dump truck when he was run over and killed. The dump truck operator was not able to see him.,traffic,traffic,正确,"The first uncontrolled action was the dump truck operator reversing the vehicle without adequate visibility, directly causing the collision. While the dump truck is equipment on-site, the incident stemmed from vehicle operation (traffic context) rather than an object being moved or machinery activated independently. The ""traffic"" samples consistently involve vehicles in motion (e.g., reversing, turning) as the initiating factor, whereas ""struck by moving objects"" samples involve non-vehicular machinery/objects (e.g., trees, backhoes). The operator��s failure to control the vehicle��s movement aligns with traffic-related causation."
