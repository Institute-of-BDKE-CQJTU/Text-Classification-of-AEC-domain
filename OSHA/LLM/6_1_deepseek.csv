Employee #1 was working from an aerial lift. Employee #1 was positioning the aerial lift and was pinned between the basket and a bridge steel beam. He was found unresponsive and died a week later.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee was pinned between the lift basket and a stationary beam, resembling entrapment between two objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the aerial lift’s movement (an uncontrolled action) caused the basket to strike/pin the victim against the beam, aligning with impacts from moving machinery."
Foreman'S Finger Is Amputated When Unguarded Saw Kicks Back,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on december 11 2013 employee #1 a carpenter foreman employed by pacific peninsula group was performing interior carpentry at a residential construction site. He was using a bosch 4000 stand-mounted benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4 inches high his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were severely cut. Emergency services were called and the mountain view fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to stanford hospital where he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger which had been completely severed past the first knuckle near the palm was surgically reattached. The left ring finger which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle also was reattached but during a return hospital visit this finger required surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to cal/osha by the employer and also reported by the mountain view fire department. In its subsequent investigation cal/osha identified the employer as a construction management company performing as a general contractor for this residential apartment building project with tasks being performed by its own employees as well as subcontractors. The task employee #1 was performing required two rip cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished piece because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches high. Employee #1 was working alone and no witness to the event was identified. The guard for the bosch 4000 included a hood a splitter and an anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the site but employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other anti-kickback attachments separate from the guard/hood available to install. He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and guiding the wood through the blade with his right hand positioned at the end of the wood length nearest to him and his left hand positioned on the top and at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push block or push stick at the saw and he did not make one to use. He stated that the first cut was almost complete and the blade was about to come out at the back side of the wood piece when the wood kicked back and shot past his right side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade before the cut but was pulled back partially by the kick-back or his hand movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard anti-kickback and spreader features of the bosch 4000 were not separable. They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that the type of rip cut employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices such as featherboards were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been installed. No protective devices such as featherboards or anti-kickback attachments were available or installed on the table saw during the time when the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were available during the time when the table saw was being used.,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as struck by moving objects because the injury occurred when the employee's hand contacted the rapidly moving saw blade, which qualifies as a moving object; it might also be classified as caught in/between objects because the blade entrapped and amputated the fingers during the cutting/kickback process, aligning with injuries caused by being caught in machinery or between tool components."
Worker'S Face Is Crushed Between Scissor Lift And Pipe,"At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 18 2013 employee #1 an electrician employed by an electrical and other wiring installation company was working as a subcontractor installing electrical wires in the stage area of a building site. He was operating a scissor lift a skyjack sj111-3219 equipment no. 103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical wires. After positioning the lift he raised the lift's platform to reach the conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit he needed to move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand to move the lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to the right. However the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately released the controller and tried to move the platform down but it continued to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and an overhead pipe. Eventually employee #1 was able to bring the platform down. Emergency services were called and the san mateo fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three days. This event was reported to cal/osha by the san mateo fire department and the employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. respectively on july 18 2013. Cal/osha initiated its investigation at the work site at approximately 10:15 a.m. on july 30 2013. Participating in the inspection were employee #1's foreman/supervisor the project superintendent of the general contractor and the field operations manager of the general contractor. The investigation revealed that employee #1's employer had leased the scissor lift from sunstate equipment since october 16 2012. The employer returned the scissor lift to sunstate equipment on july 19 2013 the day after employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's possession the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering problem and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability to go up. Cal/osha did not issue an accident-related citation because the investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of title 8 california code of regulations (t8 ccr). However cal/osha issued one general citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the proper use of skyjack iii 3219 scissor lift in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions and section 3203 injury and illness prevention program a violation of t8 ccr section 3638(d).",caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the worker’s face was crushed between the scissor lift guardrail and a pipe, fitting the definition of entrapment between two objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the scissor lift’s unintended upward motion caused the guardrail to act as a moving object that forcibly struck the worker against the pipe, aligning with impacts from machinery in motion."
Two Injured When Caught Between Boom Basket And Wall,On july 18 2007 employees #1 and #2 were assigned to weld the facade of a mezzanine.

A forklift with a tipping dump box was being used to transport and unload trash into the dumpster. The employee released the locking lever of the tipping dump box. The tipping motion of the dump box caught the employee's fingers between the tipping box and the forklift. The employee's fingers were amputated.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee’s fingers were crushed between the tipping dump box and the forklift, fitting the definition of body parts caught between objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the uncontrolled motion of the dump box (a moving machine component) directly caused the injury, aligning with impacts from active machinery parts."
Employee Dies When Pinned Inside Aerial Lift Platform,On december 1 2010 employee #1 painted a four story condominium complex. The first floor of the complex was an open area designed for resident parking. Employee #1 operated a jlg model 600s serial number 0954270300042766 aerial lift. He worked from an elevated work platform. Employee #1 had his back to the building. He attempted to position the aerial lift to begin painting the window trim and either moved the aerial lift or boomed the mast out. As a result employee #1 became pinned between the building and the control station inside the elevated working platform. Employee #1 suffered severe injuries including contusions and abrasions. Other employees at the work site found employee #1 pinned between the edge of the garage and the controls of the aerial lift. Employee #1 was taken by helicopter to a local hospital. On december 14 2010 employee #1 died in the hospital from the injuries he sustained in this accident.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee was pinned between the aerial lift’s control station and the building, resembling entrapment between two objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the aerial lift itself (a moving machine) actively moved into the victim, functioning as the uncontrolled striking force."
Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Articulating Boom,On july 8 2009 employee #1 was pressure testing a new 10-in. Refrigeration line. He was crushed between the basket of the articulating boom and a new 2-in. Refrigeration line. He was killed.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee was crushed between the boom basket and a refrigeration line, resembling entrapment between two objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the articulating boom’s basket likely moved dynamically (not static), striking the victim as a controlled/mobile machine part."
Employee Is Asphyxiated While Working From Aerial Lift,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on april 27 2007 employee #1 was working from an aerial lift jlg model number 400s serial number 30079117 approximately 21 feet above ground welding steel bracing under the ceiling of a commercial building under construction. A coworker noticed that employee #1 seemed to be not moving and blue in the face. Employee #1 was lowered to the ground and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation started but was unsuccessful. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene apparently due to being caught between the aerial lift and a brace. The aerial lift was later tested and problems were identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering. There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and spring. Once the granular material was removed the control stick functioned properly and self centered.,caught in/between objects,others,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee was physically pinned between the aerial lift and a brace, resembling entrapment by machinery; it might also be classified as others because the **first uncontrolled action** was the malfunction of the aerial lift’s control stick (due to granular buildup and lack of lubrication), which caused unintended movement of the boom—a mechanical failure not explicitly covered by other categories."
Employee Injured While Operating Unisul Spraying Machine,On november 12 2002 six employees were spraying a fire retardant onto steel columns and beams at a jobsite. During this operation two machines were in use which required three persons each to operate it. On one of the machines one employee served as a foreman one sprayed the retardant and one dumped the material into the unisul spraying machine (employee #1). Employee #1 was in the process of dumping the fire retardant material into the hopper of the unisul machine when the machine jammed. He tried to correct the jam by pushing some of the material down towards the auger. His arm became caught by the tines which feeds material into the auger. An electrician noticed employee #1 yelling for help and immediately cut the electrical power to the machine. Emergency services were contacted and employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was hospitalized and treated for a puncture wound to his forearm. The machine did not have a point of contact guarded which would have kept any of his body parts from coming in contact with the augers in the hopper during the operation cycle.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because his arm became entangled in the machine’s tines during operation, resembling entrapment in machinery components; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the tines were actively feeding material into the auger, functioning as moving parts that struck and injured the victim during their motion."
Employee Killed When Caught Between Steel Beam And Console,At approximately 1:50 p.m. on july 31 2001 employee #1 was working alone in the personnel platform of an extensible and articulating boom lift that is an aerial lift. Employee #1 was killed when his neck was caught between the bottom of an outside flange of an overhead steel beam and the platform control console. An investigation revealed that the aerial lift was used in an area where there was a low overhead clearance and that the aerial lift turntable was driven in a position which was contrary to the manufacturer's instructions. It appeared that employee #1 drove the equipment with the boom positioned over the equipment front steering wheels instead of over the equipment rear axle and driving wheels causing the controls to propel the equipment in the opposite direction than intended.,caught in/between objects,struck by moving objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text might be classified as caught in/between objects because the employee was pinned between a stationary steel beam and the platform console, resembling entrapment between two objects; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the aerial lift’s unintended movement (due to improper positioning) functionally acted as a moving mechanism that propelled the victim into the beam, aligning with impacts caused by equipment motion."

Employee #1 suffered a fracture pelvis lacerated bladder and trauma to the scrotum area. Employee #1 was hospitalized.,collapse of object,caught in/between objects,collapse of object,正确,"The text might be classified as collapse of object because the crane tipping could be misconstrued as a structural failure (e.g., crane collapse); it might also be classified as caught in/between objects because the first uncontrolled action was the crane tipping due to operational error (outriggers not deployed), which trapped the victim between the k-rail and crane, aligning with machinery-related entrapment."
Employee Falls Through Floor  Fractures Wrist And Vertebra,At approximately 12:30 p.m. on june 12 2008 employee #1 was pouring concrete to make stairs on the side of the house being remodeled. Employee #1 walked across the second floor of the house through the framing of the wall and stepped on a plywood sheet that collapsed. Employee #1 said he went through the framing and stood on the plywood surface to see if the concrete vibrator was plugged into a spider box located at a lower level. The joists as well as other supports (concrete supports) were removed by the carpenters the morning of the accident due to the demolition project. The carpenters were going to renail the plywood onto new joists. The wood framing employee #1 walked through did not have any openings 18 in. Or wider so it was not a wall opening that required a guardrail. Employee #1 was never told about the unsupported surface. However the project manager of the general contractor said employee #1 was told about the hazard before the injury. Employee #1 fell 9 ft to the ground when the unsupported surface collapsed. Employee #1 suffered a fractured left wrist stretched tendons in his left hand and a fractured and compressed l1 vertebra. Employee #1 was hospitalized for five days.,collapse of object,falls,collapse of object,正确,"The text might be classified as collapse of object because the plywood collapse resulted from structural supports (joists and concrete) being intentionally removed during demolition, creating a structural failure scenario; it might also be classified as falls because the plywood itself was not a structural component but an unsecured temporary surface, and the fall occurred from elevation without explicit evidence of a broader structural collapse (e.g., framing or walls)."
Employee Is Injured In Aerial Lift Collapse,At approximately 10:45 a.m. on september 19 2009 employee #1 was operating an eagle 44 towable boom lift (serial number 17901) at an approximate height of 32 ft to remove signs located outside of a retail store.

Employee Injured In Fall From Unsecured Trough,On november 17 1999 employee #1 and another employee were installing a trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in. Bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the trough onto the supports and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the neighboring trough system while another employee tack welded the two troughs systems together. This procedure exposed employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As employee #1 stood upon the uneven trough a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly 20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However the fall of the far end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level) causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received surgical and postoperative treatment.,collapse of object,falls,collapse of object,正确,"The text might be classified as collapse of object because the steel support’s bolt failure and partial trough collapse initiated the chain of events, suggesting structural instability; it might also be classified as falls because the first uncontrolled action (employee being knocked off due to twisting) directly resulted in a fall from elevation, aligning with fall-specific mechanisms despite the structural trigger."

Employee'S Arm Fractured In Fall When Crane Overturns,"On december 26 2007 employee #1 was operating a p&h; lattice truck-mounted boom crane model #9150 serial #51529. He had completed work at a tilt-up panel commercial construction job in monrovia ca and was dismantling the crane for travel. Previously he had unmounted a rear counterweight and set it on a flatbed truck on one side of the site. This was necessary because the crane had become stuck in the mud that formed after several days of heavy rain. To remove the counterweight the crane had been jacked up and plywood placed under the wheels to free the crane. Employee #1 then moved the crane to the other side of the site to unload a spreader bar and associated rigging onto another flatbed. He did not set the outriggers before starting this job. Employee #1 then tried to ""get a better look"" at the position of the second flatbed truck which apparently had pulled up farther than he had anticipated. He started to swing the crane to the left and also to boom up on the tires when the crane began to tip. Employee #1 attempted to jump free of the crane as it was going over and suffered a fractured right arm. He was transported to huntington memorial hospital for treatment.

It appeared that employee #1 had been electrocuted and was pronounced dead on the site.,electrocution,others,electrocution,正确,"The text might be classified as electrocution because the employee was found dead with apparent signs of electrocution pronounced on-site; it might also be classified as others if the fatal incident stemmed from an unobserved/unreported natural cause (e.g., sudden cardiac arrest) that occurred independently during the installation task, mimicking electrocution symptoms."
Electric Shock,A power line crew was installing all dielectric self-supporting fiber-optic cable onto structures supporting an existing 69-kilovolt overhead power line. As part of the project the crew reinforced the existing structures and installed the fiber-optic cable. To install the cable the crew would hang sheaves use a pulling rope to pull the cable through the sheaves and permanently attach the cable to the structure. The employees would reinforce the existing structures by replacing some poles installing additional cross braces below the power line and installing supporting braces above the crossarm. The employees worked with the power line energized some of the time and deenergized at other times. The employer relied on employee work practices to avoid violating the minimum approach distance when the line was energized. However because of the placement of the braces and fiber-optic cable maintaining the minimum approach distance was not possible on most structures. One of the employees was completing the task of clipping in the fiber-optic cable on a two-pole structure while the power line was energized. The employee was attaching the cable to the structure with a housing that included a rubber boot and reinforcing rods. As the employee was wrapping the rods around the cable one of the rods got stuck. When he jerked on the 1.8-meter-long rod to free it it passed too close to the power line and current arced to the rod. The employee was electrocuted and set on fire by the electric arc. His coworkers conducted pole-top rescue lowered him to the ground and administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Their efforts were to no avail as the injured employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,electrocution,fires and explosion,electrocution,正确,"The text might be classified as electrocution because the fatal injury directly resulted from an electric arc caused by violating the minimum approach distance to an energized power line; it might also be classified as fires and explosion because the electric arc ignited flames that ""set [the employee] on fire,"" emphasizing the combustion outcome despite the electrical origin."

Electric Shock,A local utility company hired an electrical contractor to install new streetlighting at the corner of a hazardous intersection. The job required installing one of the streetlights parallel to an existing 13.2-kilovolt (phase-to-phase) overhead power line. The ground worker installed the streetlighting hardware and supply cable on the pole placed a synthetic nylon sling with a choker hitch around the pole and attached the sling to the load line of a derrick truck. When the derrick lifted the pole to an upright position the derrick's tilt-pole plumber arms grasped the shaft of the pole. The operator of the derrick truck swung the load around and began to set the pole in a 1.8-meter-deep hole. The ground worker was securing the cargo straps to the pole trailer as the derrick operator was setting the pole. When the butt end of the pole contacted the bottom of the hole the pole spun the streetlight into the overhead line. The ground worker ran to the pole to try to prevent it from contacting the overhead line. He was electrocuted when he touched the supply cable on the pole. He had entry and exit wounds on his right hand and right heel.,electrocution,struck by moving objects,electrocution,正确,"The text might be classified as electrocution because the worker was directly shocked by contact with an energized supply cable; it might also be classified as struck by moving objects because the pole's unintended movement into the overhead line (due to derrick operation) initiated the hazardous event, which could be misconstrued as a moving object causing the accident."
Employee Injured By Flash Burns When Pump Arced Over,At 11:00 a.m. on may 30 2003 employee #1 received flash burns on the face and left arm. Employee #1 worked for a fire suppression system contractor. Employee #1 a supervisor was in the process of finishing up work on the fire suppression pump and standpipe system. The test was an annual flow test. The system is rather large as it services a large warehouse complex for a food supplier concern. The test had been completed and the system was about to be restored to normal status. According to witness statements one phase of a 480-volt three-phase panel main servicing the pump arced over producing a flash and an accompanying fire. According to employee #1 and to witnesses it is believed that a lug securing the middle leg in the three-wire assembly coming into the panel was loose and that this coupled with repeated wear caused a gap in the connection resulting in the arc and flash over. Employee #1 sustained second and third-degree burns to the face and was hospitalized.,electrocution,fires and explosion,electrocution,正确,"The text might be classified as electrocution because the arc flash originated from an electrical fault (loose lug in a 480V panel), directly linking to electrical burns; it might also be classified as fires and explosion because the arc caused a flash and fire, emphasizing the thermal burn injury mechanism rather than the electrical fault as the primary uncontrolled action."
Employee Injured By Electric Shock From Contact With Busbar,At approximately 9:15 a.m. on july 19 2004 employee #1 an electrician's helper was helping to rewire an old high-rise office building in los angeles ca. He applied fire stop to the electrical conduits in the walls on the first floor. The conduits brought wires up from the basement where high-voltage power lines entered the building and reduced the voltage to 120/240 volts. Employee #1 then remembered a 1 1/2 in. Conduit inside one of the service cabinets which was on the ground floor. The conduit needed a strap installed before more power lines could be brought up from the basement. Employee #1 removed two corner screws in the cabinet's door so he could open it and he was leaning forward over the splash apron to access the conduit when his head contacted a 120-volt busbar. He received an electric shock and was rendered unconscious. A coworker started cpr and revived him. Employee #1 sustained small burns on the bottom of his right arm and left thumb which provided paths for the electricity and a severe burn on the right front part of his skull. All the service cabinets on the first floor were de-energized except for one that was backfed to supply 120 volts for lighting the building. The cabinet employee #1 opened had a lockout on the breaker that was accessible from outside the cabinet however when he removed the corner screws the lock stayed on the breaker as the door opened. The busbars inside the cabinet were also backfed and had the breaker been closed an explosion would have occurred in the basement.,electrocution,fires and explosion,electrocution,正确,"The text might be classified as electrocution because the direct cause of injury was electric shock from contact with an energized busbar; it might also be classified as fires and explosion because the accident explicitly describes a backfed electrical cabinet and warns that closing the breaker would have caused an explosion in the basement, creating ambiguity between the actual shock event and the latent explosion hazard."

He had worked for har construction co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall employee #1 was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the investigation coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00 a.m. when employee #1 while still up on the fourth floor walked over near the work area on the third floor where coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1 told employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to coworker #1 from either inside or outside the guarded area. After coworker #1 took the lumber employee #1 told coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform nearby. Within seconds employee #1 fell from the south side of the fourth floor platform to a concrete floor area on the third floor.

Telecommunication Worker Is Killed In Fall From Aerial Lift,On july 23 2012 employee #1 and two coworkers were installing a guy for a utilility pole across the intersection of central avenue pike and beaver creek lane in knoxville tennessee. One coworker was a flagger and the other was a lineman. The flagger was out on central avenue pike to control traffic on central avenue pike before a section of cable was laid across the intersection. Employee #1 used an aerial lift to attach one end of the guy to the utility pole on the west side of central avenue pike. Employee #1 boomed down and the truck was moved to another utility pole on beaver creek lane. The crew made sure that there was enough slack in the cable so that the cable would lie flat across the intersection. Employee #1 raised the bucket to an estimated height of 15 feet (4.6 meters) in order to hang the guy on the utility pole. At that point employee #1 saw that he had connected the guy on the south side of a fiber optic cable that was installed diagonally across beaver creek lane when it needed to be on the north side. Employee #1 boomed down and asked the lineman to hand him the cable. Employee #1 had the flagger put down the flagging sign come over to the bucket truck cut the cable from the reel and hand it to him. The flagger left the roadway walked across the street and cut the cable using a pair of bolt cutters. Employee #1 had the cable in his hand but not the end of the cable. He was going try to get it over the fiber optic cable line. Employee #1 boomed up to an estimated height of 20 feet (6.1 meters) and jerked the cable up which reduced the slack in the cable that was supposed to be lying flat across central avenue pike. Before the flagger or lineman could get back to the roadway they heard noises. A pickup truck traveling southbound on central avenue pike drove over the cable and the cable became caught in its rear bumper. The lineman took off running to an open field but he was hit in the back by the cable 5 or 6 times. Employee #1 who was not wearing a harness or lanyard fell approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) to the ground. The coworkers came over to the bucket truck and saw employee #1 lying on the ground. The lineman called emergency medical services and local law enforcement and first responders arrived. Employee #1 was transported to the university of tennessee medical center in knoxville tn. He had been killed.,traffic,falls,others,错误,"The text might be classified as traffic because the incident involved a pickup truck interacting with the cable, creating a vehicular hazard ; it might also be classified as falls because the fatal injury resulted directly from Employee #1 falling 20 feet from the aerial lift due to lack of fall protection, independent of the truck’s role in triggering the event."
