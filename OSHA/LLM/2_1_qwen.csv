Employee Is Caught Between Lift Bucket And Beam And Killed,On april 30 2012 employee #1 with walsh construction was placing bridge girders and beams while working on a temporary ramp leading to a bridge. Employee #1 was working from an aerial lift. Employee #1 was positioning the aerial lift and was pinned between the basket and a bridge steel beam. He was found unresponsive and died a week later.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The incident involves the employee being pinned between the aerial lift bucket and a bridge steel beam, which directly corresponds to the definition of the ""caught in/between objects"" category. Although there is a potential confusion point regarding the movement of the lift bucket, the core issue described in the text is the entrapment between two objects, not being struck by a falling object. This aligns with the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident."
Foreman'S Finger Is Amputated When Unguarded Saw Kicks Back,At approximately 10:00 a.m. on december 11 2013 employee #1 a carpenter foreman employed by pacific peninsula group was performing interior carpentry at a residential construction site. He was using a bosch 4000 stand-mounted benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4 inches high his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were severely cut. Emergency services were called and the mountain view fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to stanford hospital where he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger which had been completely severed past the first knuckle near the palm was surgically reattached. The left ring finger which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle also was reattached but during a return hospital visit this finger required surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to cal/osha by the employer and also reported by the mountain view fire department. In its subsequent investigation cal/osha identified the employer as a construction management company performing as a general contractor for this residential apartment building project with tasks being performed by its own employees as well as subcontractors. The task employee #1 was performing required two rip cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished piece because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches high. Employee #1 was working alone and no witness to the event was identified. The guard for the bosch 4000 included a hood a splitter and an anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the site but employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other anti-kickback attachments separate from the guard/hood available to install. He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and guiding the wood through the blade with his right hand positioned at the end of the wood length nearest to him and his left hand positioned on the top and at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push block or push stick at the saw and he did not make one to use. He stated that the first cut was almost complete and the blade was about to come out at the back side of the wood piece when the wood kicked back and shot past his right side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade before the cut but was pulled back partially by the kick-back or his hand movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard anti-kickback and spreader features of the bosch 4000 were not separable. They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that the type of rip cut employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices such as featherboards were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been installed. No protective devices such as featherboards or anti-kickback attachments were available or installed on the table saw during the time when the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were available during the time when the table saw was being used.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the direct contact between the employee's hand and the rotating blade of the table saw, which resulted in severe cuts and amputations. This scenario aligns more closely with the ""caught in/between objects"" category, as it involves the interaction between the moving blade and the stationary wood piece, leading to the employee's hand being caught and subsequently injured. The definition of ""struck by moving objects"" typically implies a scenario where an object hits the victim from a distance, whereas in this case, the injury was due to the employee's hand being caught directly in the mechanism of the saw."
Worker'S Face Is Crushed Between Scissor Lift And Pipe,"At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 18 2013 employee #1 an electrician employed by an electrical and other wiring installation company was working as a subcontractor installing electrical wires in the stage area of a building site. He was operating a scissor lift a skyjack sj111-3219 equipment no. 103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical wires. After positioning the lift he raised the lift's platform to reach the conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit he needed to move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand to move the lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to the right. However the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately released the controller and tried to move the platform down but it continued to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and an overhead pipe. Eventually employee #1 was able to bring the platform down. Emergency services were called and the san mateo fire department responded. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for multiple facial fractures. He was hospitalized for approximately three days. This event was reported to cal/osha by the san mateo fire department and the employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. respectively on july 18 2013. Cal/osha initiated its investigation at the work site at approximately 10:15 a.m. on july 30 2013. Participating in the inspection were employee #1's foreman/supervisor the project superintendent of the general contractor and the field operations manager of the general contractor. The investigation revealed that employee #1's employer had leased the scissor lift from sunstate equipment since october 16 2012. The employer returned the scissor lift to sunstate equipment on july 19 2013 the day after employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's possession the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering problem and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability to go up. Cal/osha did not issue an accident-related citation because the investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of title 8 california code of regulations (t8 ccr). However cal/osha issued one general citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the proper use of skyjack iii 3219 scissor lift in accordance with the manufacturer's operating instructions and section 3203 injury and illness prevention program a violation of t8 ccr section 3638(d).",caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the worker's face being caught between the lift's top guardrail and an overhead pipe. Although the lift's unexpected upward movement played a role, the defining characteristic of the injury was being caught between two stationary objects, aligning more closely with the ""caught in/between objects"" category."
Two Injured When Caught Between Boom Basket And Wall,On july 18 2007 employees #1 and #2 were assigned to weld the facade of a mezzanine. One of the workers raised the articulating boom basket too far and both employees' heads necks and shoulders became caught between the control pedestal of the lift and the face of the mezzanine. Employees #1 and #2 sustained injuries for which they were treated and released the same day.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text describes employees becoming trapped between the control pedestal of the lift and the wall, which aligns closely with the definition of the ""caught in/between objects"" category. This scenario does not involve an object falling from a height due to structural failure or external forces, thus it does not fit the ""struck by falling object"" category. The primary cause of the incident is the entrapment between two objects, making ""caught in/between objects"" the correct classification."
Employee Hit While In Trench By Back Hoe.,Employee #1 suffered nonserious injury to his right knee when he placed his knee between a backhoe bucket and the wall of a deep trench. Employee #1 moved the bucket in towards himself and it pinched his knee against the dirt sidewall of the trench.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The text describes the incident where Employee #1 was injured when his knee was pinched between the backhoe bucket and the dirt sidewall of the trench. This situation clearly fits the definition of ""caught in/between objects"" as it involves being caught between two objects, specifically the backhoe bucket and the trench wall. Although there is mention of a trench, which might suggest a potential structural failure, the primary cause of the injury was the mechanical action of the backhoe bucket rather than any collapse or structural failure of the trench itself. Therefore, based on the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, ""caught in/between objects"" is the appropriate classification."
Employee Crushes Finger In Tunnel Boring Machine,At approximately 12:15 a.m. on june 29 2004 an employee who was a miner and laborer was working with a tunnel boring machine (tbm) segment erector. The employee noticed a shim out of position and reached in between the segments to reset the shim while the erector jacks were in motion resulting in his fingers getting caught between two concrete segments. The employee was hospitalized with a crushing injury to his right hand and later required hand surgery.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee's fingers being caught between two concrete segments while they were in motion, which aligns more closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects."" Although the segments were moving, the mechanism of injury is best described by being caught between the moving parts rather than being struck by them. The examples provided under ""caught in/between objects"" also involve body parts becoming entrapped in machinery parts during motion, which closely mirrors the situation described in the text."
Employee Amputates Fingers In Tipping Dump Box Incident,The employee was clearing trash in a large dumpster. A forklift with a tipping dump box was being used to transport and unload trash into the dumpster. The employee released the locking lever of the tipping dump box. The tipping motion of the dump box caught the employee's fingers between the tipping box and the forklift. The employee's fingers were amputated.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee's fingers being caught between the tipping dump box and the forklift, which directly aligns with the definition of the ""caught in/between objects"" category. Although the dump box tipped, leading to the injury, the nature of the injury—fingers getting trapped between two objects—is more accurately described by the ""caught in/between objects"" category than by ""struck by falling object,"" which typically involves objects falling from a height and striking someone."
Employee Dies When Pinned Inside Aerial Lift Platform,On december 1 2010 employee #1 painted a four story condominium complex. The first floor of the complex was an open area designed for resident parking. Employee #1 operated a jlg model 600s serial number 0954270300042766 aerial lift. He worked from an elevated work platform. Employee #1 had his back to the building. He attempted to position the aerial lift to begin painting the window trim and either moved the aerial lift or boomed the mast out. As a result employee #1 became pinned between the building and the control station inside the elevated working platform. Employee #1 suffered severe injuries including contusions and abrasions. Other employees at the work site found employee #1 pinned between the edge of the garage and the controls of the aerial lift. Employee #1 was taken by helicopter to a local hospital. On december 14 2010 employee #1 died in the hospital from the injuries he sustained in this accident.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee becoming pinned between the building and the control station of the aerial lift, which aligns more closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects."" While the movement of the aerial lift contributed to the situation, the core event that led to the severe injuries and death was the entrapment between two stationary objects. This is consistent with the examples provided under the ""caught in/between objects"" category, where individuals were also pinned between structures or equipment components."
Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Articulating Boom,On july 8 2009 employee #1 was pressure testing a new 10-in. Refrigeration line. He was crushed between the basket of the articulating boom and a new 2-in. Refrigeration line. He was killed.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee being crushed between the basket of the articulating boom and a refrigeration line. Although the boom is capable of movement, the description focuses on the static position of the objects involved in the crushing incident, aligning more closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects"" rather than ""struck by moving objects."""
Employee Is Asphyxiated While Working From Aerial Lift,At approximately 11:30 a.m. on april 27 2007 employee #1 was working from an aerial lift jlg model number 400s serial number 30079117 approximately 21 feet above ground welding steel bracing under the ceiling of a commercial building under construction. A coworker noticed that employee #1 seemed to be not moving and blue in the face. Employee #1 was lowered to the ground and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation started but was unsuccessful. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene apparently due to being caught between the aerial lift and a brace. The aerial lift was later tested and problems were identified with the control stick which controlled upward movement of the boom. The control stick would not self-center or stop movement of the boom when released slowly as required by the manufacturer. Examination of the control stick found that hardened and compacted granular material built up on the centering ring and spring prevented the control stick from centering. There was also an absence of grease or lubricant on the centering ring and spring. Once the granular material was removed the control stick functioned properly and self centered.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"Although the primary cause of death was asphyxiation, the text specifically mentions that the employee was caught between the aerial lift and a brace, which aligns more closely with the ""caught in/between objects"" category. This scenario involves physical entrapment leading to asphyxiation,不同于化学物质暴露类别中描述的因有害气体或缺氧导致的窒息。因此，根据选择主要事故原因的原则，应将此事件分类为“被物体夹住/卡住”。"
Employee Injured While Operating Unisul Spraying Machine,On november 12 2002 six employees were spraying a fire retardant onto steel columns and beams at a jobsite. During this operation two machines were in use which required three persons each to operate it. On one of the machines one employee served as a foreman one sprayed the retardant and one dumped the material into the unisul spraying machine (employee #1). Employee #1 was in the process of dumping the fire retardant material into the hopper of the unisul machine when the machine jammed. He tried to correct the jam by pushing some of the material down towards the auger. His arm became caught by the tines which feeds material into the auger. An electrician noticed employee #1 yelling for help and immediately cut the electrical power to the machine. Emergency services were contacted and employee #1 was transported to the hospital. He was hospitalized and treated for a puncture wound to his forearm. The machine did not have a point of contact guarded which would have kept any of his body parts from coming in contact with the augers in the hopper during the operation cycle.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The incident primarily involves Employee #1 becoming caught between the moving tines of the auger and the material he was handling, which aligns closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects"". Although the auger is a moving object, the primary mechanism of injury is the trapping action between the moving parts and the employee, which is more consistent with the ""caught in/between objects"" category as exemplified in the similar samples provided."
Employee Killed When Caught Between Steel Beam And Console,At approximately 1:50 p.m. on july 31 2001 employee #1 was working alone in the personnel platform of an extensible and articulating boom lift that is an aerial lift. Employee #1 was killed when his neck was caught between the bottom of an outside flange of an overhead steel beam and the platform control console. An investigation revealed that the aerial lift was used in an area where there was a low overhead clearance and that the aerial lift turntable was driven in a position which was contrary to the manufacturer's instructions. It appeared that employee #1 drove the equipment with the boom positioned over the equipment front steering wheels instead of over the equipment rear axle and driving wheels causing the controls to propel the equipment in the opposite direction than intended.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee being caught between the steel beam and the console of the aerial lift. While the movement of the aerial lift contributed to the scenario, the defining characteristic of the accident aligns more closely with the ""caught in/between objects"" category, as it involves the employee being compressed between two stationary objects at the moment of the incident. This matches the descriptions in the similar samples provided under this category."
Employee Killed When Head Strikes Tractor'S Protective Cage,At approximately 2:00 p.m. on december 21 1995 employee #1 was clearing brush from around a water settlement pond. To stabilize himself he tied a rope around himself while a coworker held the other end. A tractor with a bush hog was mowing grass in the area. The loose end of the rope became wrapped around the bush hog. The rope was pulled from the coworker's grip and pulled employee #1 into the tractor's protective cage. Employee #1 died of head injuries.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee being pulled into the tractor's protective cage by the rope, resulting in entrapment. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects"" which involves being caught between objects, leading to injury. Although the protective cage can be considered a moving object, the mechanism of injury primarily involves entrapment rather than a direct strike, making ""caught in/between objects"" the more appropriate classification."
Employee'S Body Is Caught In Asphalt Machine  Dies,On november 27 2012 employee #1 was operating an asphalt-pulverizing machine. The employee's work clothing zipper was caught in the asphalt-pulverizing machine pulling his body into the squeeze point action of the machine. Employee #1 was amputated from the abdominal point of his body. The employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee's clothing becoming entangled in the asphalt-pulverizing machine, which aligns with the definition of ""caught in/between objects"" as it involves being caught in machinery leading to severe injury. Although the machine's moving parts contributed to the injury, the fundamental issue was the entrapment mechanism rather than a direct strike."
Employee Is Pinned Between Truck And Trailer  Dies,At approximately 7:00 a.m. on november 27 2912 employee #1 was delivering pipes for a water line installation. The employee was working alone and parked the trailer truck. Employee #1 unhooked the trailer from the truck and the trailer rolled forward. The employee was pinned between the truck and the trailer. A coworker realized the employee#1 had not returned and went to look for him. The coworker found employee #1 caught between the truck and trailer. Another coworker called emergency medical services and employee #1 was transported to a trauma unit where he was pronounced dead.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"Although the trailer was initially moving, the primary cause of the incident leading to the employee's death was being caught and pinned between the stationary truck and the trailer. This aligns more closely with the ""caught in/between objects"" category, as the final state involves entrapment between two objects, which is consistent with the provided examples where individuals are caught between machinery or vehicles. The traffic category focuses more on incidents directly involving the movement of vehicles striking individuals, which does not fully capture the nature of this entrapment scenario."
Employee'S Toe Injured By Falling Compactor,At approximately 8:10 a.m. on december 12 1991 employee #1 of santa maria electric inc. was operating a walk-behind sheep foot compactor. When he was lowering it into a trench that was about 3 ft wide by 2 ft deep the bumper fell down against the dirt bank catching employee #1's big toe between the bumper and the dirt bank. His toe suffered a chipped bone injury. Employee #1 was wearing regular work boots not hard toe shoes or any other foot protection.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee's toe being caught between the compactor's bumper and the dirt bank, which aligns with the definition of ""caught in/between objects."" Although there is a potential to view the bumper's movement as a structural failure, the core issue leading to the injury was the entrapment between the moving bumper and the static dirt bank, making ""caught in/between objects"" the more appropriate category according to the given principle."
Employee'S Arm Is Amputated In Concrete Truck Mixer,On january 13 2005 employee #1 a concrete truck driver arrived at a job site to pour footing concrete into an on-site concrete pump. After realizing that the concrete was too muddy he climbed the ladder and added 50 pounds of lime to dry out the concrete mix. Employee #1 allowed the concrete mixer to run for approximately 15 minutes checked the concrete and again determined the concrete was too muddy. He climbed back up the ladder and added the contents of a 90-pound bag of cement into the upper hopper. While pouring cement the bag slipped out of his hand. When he quickly reached for it his right jacket arm became caught in the hopper causing his arm to be pulled in. Employee #1 was hospitalized for an arm amputation at the elbow.,caught in/between objects,caught in/between objects,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee's arm becoming caught in the hopper of the concrete mixer, which aligns with the definition of ""caught in/between objects."" Although the bag of cement falling could be considered a contributing factor, the direct cause of the injury, which resulted in the arm amputation, was the entrapment mechanism rather than the impact from the falling object."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Collapsing Wall,On april 30 2008 employee #1 was using a sludge hammer to knock down a 9-ft high cinder block asbestos wall. He struck the wall near the bottom causing the wall to collapse on him. Employee #1 was killed. He did not use scaffolding to access the upper parts of the wall first.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the collapse of the asbestos wall, which aligns with the definition of ""collapse of object"" involving structural failure. Although the wall's collapse resulted in the employee being struck by the falling debris, the initial and primary event was the structural failure of the wall itself, not an object simply falling from a height. Therefore, ""collapse of object"" is the most appropriate classification according to the given principle."
One Employee Killed One Injured In Fall From Elevation,Employee #1 was on a column preparing to connect a beam. Employee #2 was positioning a man-lift to connect the other end of the beam to another column. The man-lift hit one of the supports holding the column and the column fell with employee #1 on it. Employee #1 was killed and employee #2 suffered a concussion but was not hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident appears to be the structural failure of the column, which fell due to the man-lift hitting one of its supports. Although Employee #1 was struck by the falling column, the root cause of the incident is the collapse of the column itself, aligning with the definition of the ""collapse of object"" category. This is further supported by the similarity of the scenario to the provided top samples under the ""collapse of object"" category, where structural failures are the main incidents."
Employee Is Killed In Trench Cave,On january 22 2008 an employee working for christopher hauswald fell into a 3 ft wide 15 ft deep trench. Moments afterwards the trench caved in on him. The employee died at the scene. No other details were provided in the narrative.%09,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the trench, leading to a cave-in. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object"" which involves cases starting with structural failure, rather than being struck by a moving object, even though the collapsing material does move during the process."
Worker Standing On Raised Plywood Falls  Sustains Injuries,On march 8 2013 an employee of hanover builders was engaged in exterior carpentry work at a residential construction site. He was standing on a sheet of plywood on joists in order to spread a stack of plywood placed next to him. The employee fell approximately 11 feet. He was transported to the hospital where he was admitted and treated for two fractured discs and fractured ribs. The employer was a framing contractor in business for 25 years. This work-related injury was reported to cal/osha on march 22 2013. The investigation determined that the joists did not brace and securely support the load that is the employee plus the stack of plywood.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the text describes the worker falling from an elevated position, the primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the joists, which did not properly support the load, leading to the collapse of the plywood platform. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object"" than the general ""falls"" category, which does not involve structural failure."
One Employees Is Injured When Boring Machine Overturns,On june 14 2012 employee #1 was working for payne mcginn and cummins inc. as operator of a boring machine. Employee # 1 was a member of a five man construction crew which included two employees employee #1 the boring operator and a laborer. Employee #1 was boring several feet under a petroleum line installing a new 20 in. Ductile iron pipe water line for the community they were working in. The excavation was about 15 feet deep 30 to 35 feet long and 12 to 15 feet wide. Employee #1 was positioned on a platform on the right side of a machine of a large horizontal mclaughlin boring 30-36 weighing approximately 5 900 pounds. Employee #1 finished boring 40 feet through the ground and was backing the machine up the machine rolled and lifted up off its 30 foot long track to the right crushing the operator while he was still at the controls. The laborer was in the excavation site he ran over to the operator when he saw the machine lifted up. The rear part of the machine caught the laborer's leg breaking it. The cause of the accident was the machine lifting off of the tracks and crushing the operator and injuring the laborer.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The accident description indicates that the machine lifted off its tracks and crushed the operator, which aligns more closely with a structural failure or collapse scenario rather than an object falling from a height. The movement and lifting of the machine suggest a collapse or failure of the machine's stability, fitting the definition of ""collapse of object"" better than ""struck by falling object,"" which typically involves an object falling from a higher position without such structural failure implications."
Employee Suffered Face Injury From A Broken Cable,On february 25 2002 a crane operator suffered a face injury when a cable broke. Emergency response was contacted but employee #1 was not taken to the hospital.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the text describes the employee being injured by a broken cable, the primary incident involves the structural failure of the crane's cable, which aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object"" as it pertains to structural failure. The first occurrence of the uncontrolled or unintended action is the breaking of the cable, which is a form of structural failure rather than simply an object falling. This makes ""collapse of object"" the more appropriate category according to the given principle."
Employee Injured When Crane Tipped,On april 23 2001 employee #1 was installing concrete traffic barriers on an interstate highway. Employee #1 was in the process of moving and setting k-rails and was operating a national crane model n-135. The k-rail was 20-ft long and weighed approximately 8 000 pounds. Employee #1 attempted to drag the k-rail closer to the crane and then attempted to lift it without the crane outriggers being fully deployed. This action resulted in overloading the crane and as a result the crane tipped. A portion of the truck-mounted crane's lighting system trapped employee #1 between the k-rail and the truck mounted crane. Employee #1 suffered a fracture pelvis lacerated bladder and trauma to the scrotum area. Employee #1 was hospitalized.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the tipping over of the crane due to improper operation, which can be considered a structural failure given the context of the collapse of object category. Although the employee was caught between the k-rail and the crane's lighting system, this secondary event is a consequence of the initial collapse, not the primary cause. Therefore, based on the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, the category ""collapse of object"" is more appropriate."
Employee Falls Through Floor  Fractures Wrist And Vertebra,At approximately 12:30 p.m. on june 12 2008 employee #1 was pouring concrete to make stairs on the side of the house being remodeled. Employee #1 walked across the second floor of the house through the framing of the wall and stepped on a plywood sheet that collapsed. Employee #1 said he went through the framing and stood on the plywood surface to see if the concrete vibrator was plugged into a spider box located at a lower level. The joists as well as other supports (concrete supports) were removed by the carpenters the morning of the accident due to the demolition project. The carpenters were going to renail the plywood onto new joists. The wood framing employee #1 walked through did not have any openings 18 in. Or wider so it was not a wall opening that required a guardrail. Employee #1 was never told about the unsupported surface. However the project manager of the general contractor said employee #1 was told about the hazard before the injury. Employee #1 fell 9 ft to the ground when the unsupported surface collapsed. Employee #1 suffered a fractured left wrist stretched tendons in his left hand and a fractured and compressed l1 vertebra. Employee #1 was hospitalized for five days.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the floor, which collapsed due to the removal of supports. Although the employee fell, the underlying issue that initiated the accident was the collapse of the unsupported surface, fitting the definition of ""collapse of object"" more accurately than the general ""falls"" category."
Employee Is Injured In Aerial Lift Collapse,At approximately 10:45 a.m. on september 19 2009 employee #1 was operating an eagle 44 towable boom lift (serial number 17901) at an approximate height of 32 ft to remove signs located outside of a retail store. When the lower boom's hydraulic cylinder apparently failed the boom fell to the ground. Witnesses indicated that employee #1 was ejected from the basket and then restrained by his fall protection equipment. He was hospitalized at renown medical hospital for severe injuries to his face fractured ribs and a fractured vertebra.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the boom's hydraulic cylinder, leading to the collapse of the boom. This aligns with the definition of ""collapse of object,"" which involves cases starting with structural failure. Although the employee was struck by the falling boom, the fundamental cause was the collapse due to mechanical failure, making ""collapse of object"" the more appropriate category according to the principle of selecting the primary cause."
Employee Drowned When Bobcat Flips And Pins Him Underwater,At approximately 8:37 a.m. on february 12 2003 an employee of watson trucking and equipment rental was operating a bobcat at a construction site. The employee was removing debris from the back of a house that was under construction. The employee was in shallow water operating the bobcat. He was observed moving the bobcat bucket in and out of the water. It appears that he was attempting to clean the bucket when the employee tried to back up out of the water. He was unsuccessful. When he tried to move the bobcat to the left the bobcat flipped over in the deepest part of the canal. The bobcat slid down the embankment coming to rest in approximately 48 ft of water. The employee was pinned under the machine and subsequently drowned.,others,collapse of object,错误,"The primary cause of the incident is the bobcat flipping over and pinning the employee underwater, leading to drowning. This scenario does not neatly fit into the ""falls"" category, which typically involves slipping or tripping from heights without the involvement of machinery flipping over. Given the specific nature of the accident and the involvement of a machine flipping, the ""others"" category is more appropriate as it accommodates cases that do not clearly fall into the predefined categories."
Employee Is Killed When Struck By Falling Joists,On october 14 2012 employee #1 and other workers were installing structural steel joists and decking to the top of cmu block walls. The joists were not yet welded into place due to heavy rain earlier in the day. When a bundle of decking was placed on top of the joists they began to roll and bend. A supervisor then had a crane move the bundle to a location where another bundle of decking had already been placed on top of the unsecured joists. When the second bundle of decking was lowered to the unsecured joists they rolled and fell onto employee #1. He was killed.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the employee was struck by the falling joists, the root cause of the incident was the structural failure of the unsecured joists, which began to roll and subsequently fell. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object,"" which involves structural failures leading to incidents. The primary cause is thus the collapse due to improper securing rather than simply being struck by a falling object."
Employee Is Struck By Wooden Post  Bruises Shoulder,On december 7 2006 employee #1 was working in a 4 ft deep excavation installing a sewage pump. Approximately 3 ft from the edge of the excavation was a 4-in. By 4-in. By 8-ft wooden post (clothes line pole) imbedded in concrete. The soil was moist. The unsupported post fell into the excavation striking the employee in the left shoulder. He sustained a bruised shoulder. Employee #1 was transported to a hospital and released that same day.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The wooden post, which was embedded in concrete and considered part of the surrounding structure, fell due to the lack of support, leading to the injury. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object,"" which involves structural failure, rather than simply an object falling from height, as indicated in the ""struck by falling object"" category. The principle of identifying the first occurrence of uncontrolled or unintended action is met by recognizing the collapse of the post as the initial event causing the injury."
Employee Falls Due To Ladder Collapse,At approximately 11:15 a.m. on november 12 2012 employee #1 of young's roofing inc. fell from an extension ladder when it collapsed while he was installing a piece of flashing about 14 feet up on the building wall. Employee #2 was working nearby and both employee #1 and employee #2 said the ladder was resting on the building at a point about 15 feet above the sidewalk. According to both workers the bottom rails of the ladder were four to five feet away from the wall. Employee #1 said he was unable to find a tie-off point for his ladder. Employee #2 said he was setting upon a second ladder on the same wall. Employee #1 said he was transferring pressure of his right arm and torso onto the ladder while he was using a cordless power-driver to install screws for the flashing into the wall. Employee #1 felt that this is what dislodged the ladder from the bottom outward away from the wall. Employee #1 was taken to stanford hospital for treatment of injuries including two broken wrists and orbital skull fracture. He was released on november 15 2012.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the ladder, which collapsed while the employee was using it.

Employee #1 fell approximately 140 ft to the third floor roof level. He was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. The scaffold was found to be improperly anchored.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the collapse of the scaffold due to improper anchoring and high winds, which aligns with the definition of ""collapse of object"" involving cases that started with structural failure. Although the employee fell from the collapsing scaffold, the fall itself is a consequence of the structural failure rather than an independent event. Therefore, according to the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, the incident should be classified as ""collapse of object""."
Employee Killed Due To Fall Down Air Draft System,An employee was working on a boom at a hospital over a 200-ft by 6-ft by 38-ft-deep air draft system. The boom started to break and the employee attempted to escape from the boom but fell into the air draft system striking the level below. He suffered bruises and contusions and was killed.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the employee ultimately fell into the air draft system, the primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the boom, which initiated the sequence of events leading to the fall.

Employee Is Struck By Glass Plate And Receives Fractures,At approximately 1 a.m. on march 21 2013 employee #1 was moving a rolling a-frame rack from a wall. A crew of two painters had placed the rack there as the suite that they were working on was being remodeled. The suite was located within in an office area of a high-rise building and was designed to have floor to ceiling glass panels that would separate the offices from the center of the suite. On the rolling glazier rack there were four sheets of glass with each of them having a dimension of 60 in. By 107 in. By 0.5 in. And weighing 284.5 pounds. Employee #1 grabbed the back of the rack and walked backward putting himself between the loaded rack and the wall but an extension cord on the floor prevented the rolling rack from moving forward and tipped the rack over. The glass panels struck the wall on one corner and then slid down trapping employee #1 in a sitting position between the loaded cart and the wall. One of the panels also struck employee #1 and caused him to sustain multiple broken ribs and a clavicle on his left side. The painters came to his rescue and lifted the glass panels off him. They then summoned emergency medical personnel. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center where he received treatment and was then hospitalized for one week. A month later he underwent surgery on his broken clavicle. The cause of the accident was a failure to instruct the laborer in the hazards associated with moving large glass panels.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the primary issue involves glass panels falling and striking the employee, the scenario closely aligns with a ""collapse of object"" as the rolling rack tipped over due to an obstruction, leading to the glass panels sliding down and trapping the employee. This sequence indicates a structural failure of the rack's stability rather than a simple falling object scenario, adhering to the principle of identifying the first occurrence of an uncontrolled or unintended action."

Employee Fractures Hip In Fall From Storage Area,At approximately 1:20 p.m. on september 24 2004 employee #1 was assigned to replenish building materials in the warehouse. He was loading building insulation with a forklift. The material comes in wrapped plastic bundles approximately 4 ft 4 in. By 3 ft 7 in. By 24 in. And weighed approximately 90 lbs. The bundles are secured with five plastic straps and stacked three high on a pallet. The area employee #1 was loading was a loft approximately 12 ft 4 in. High. The procedure is to load the first pallet with the forklift then load the next pallet pushing with the forklift to make room. On this particular occasion employee #1 had loaded three or four pallets when one of the top bundles became misaligned. He got off the forklift climbed up a fixed ladder on the side of the shelf picked up the bundle by the plastic strapping and began to turn the bundle using the plastic straps. He felt the strap he was holding snap and was catapulted off the shelf. He first fell onto the forklift and then fell from there to the concrete floor breaking his hip. The foreman was first on the scene and found employee #1 conscious on the floor. Employee #1 told him that he had been trying to turn a bundle when a strap he was holding snapped and he fell. He also said he felt pain in his hip. The police was called and the employee was transported to the hospital via ambulance. The foreman investigated the bundles the employee had been loading and could not find a misaligned bundle nor any bundles on the shelf with broken straps. The forks were in a raised position and backed away approximately 2 ft from the last loaded bundle. The edge of this bundle was aligned with the edge of the shelf. The ladder the employee climbed to access the location was on the side of the forklift opposite to that where the employee was ultimately found. He was hospitalized with a fractured hip..,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee's fall from height after the strap he was holding snapped, leading to him falling onto the forklift and subsequently to the concrete floor. Although the strap snapping could imply a bundle falling, the main event described focuses on the employee's fall and the resultant injury, which aligns more closely with the ""falls"" category. The incident does not primarily involve the employee being struck by a falling object, thus ""falls"" is the more appropriate classification."

Employee Injured In Fall From Unsecured Trough,On november 17 1999 employee #1 and another employee were installing a trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in. Bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the trough onto the supports and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the neighboring trough system while another employee tack welded the two troughs systems together. This procedure exposed employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As employee #1 stood upon the uneven trough a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly 20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However the fall of the far end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level) causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received surgical and postoperative treatment.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"Although the incident primarily describes an employee falling, the first uncontrolled action that led to the fall was the partial collapse of the trough system, which is indicative of structural failure. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object"" than with the general category of ""falls,"" which typically involves slips or trips without underlying structural failures."

Employee'S Arm Fractured In Fall When Crane Overturns,"On december 26 2007 employee #1 was operating a p&h; lattice truck-mounted boom crane model #9150 serial #51529. He had completed work at a tilt-up panel commercial construction job in monrovia ca and was dismantling the crane for travel. Previously he had unmounted a rear counterweight and set it on a flatbed truck on one side of the site. This was necessary because the crane had become stuck in the mud that formed after several days of heavy rain. To remove the counterweight the crane had been jacked up and plywood placed under the wheels to free the crane. Employee #1 then moved the crane to the other side of the site to unload a spreader bar and associated rigging onto another flatbed. He did not set the outriggers before starting this job. Employee #1 then tried to ""get a better look"" at the position of the second flatbed truck which apparently had pulled up farther than he had anticipated. He started to swing the crane to the left and also to boom up on the tires when the crane began to tip. Employee #1 attempted to jump free of the crane as it was going over and suffered a fractured right arm. He was transported to huntington memorial hospital for treatment. Employee #1 later stated that he felt he had been in error because he should have set the outriggers before starting the task underway at the time of the accident.",collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the crane tipping over, which aligns with the definition of ""collapse of object"" involving structural failure. Although the employee was struck by the crane as it fell, the initiating and primary event is the structural failure and tipping of the crane, not a freely falling object."
Employee Injured From Falling Piping,"On november 19 2000 employee #1 was carrying paneling when he heard someone shout ""headache "" then he was struck by several objects including screen wall tubing and scaffolding boards. The tubing fell about 13 stories (or 157 ft) and collided with stationary scaffolding. The collision impeded the force of the falling tubing (weighing approximately 200 pounds) and dislodged a portion of the scaffolding boards. The ricocheting objects knocked him to the ground striking his back and pinning his leg under a piping valve. Another employee who witnessed the accident ran to his location to provide him with aid. Emergency medical services were summoned and he was transported to the hospital. In the hospital he received treatment for injuries consisting of abrasions contusions and lacerations across his entire body.",struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"The primary cause of the incident was the impact of falling objects (screen wall tubing and scaffolding boards) on the employee, which aligns with the definition of ""struck by falling object."" Although the objects fell from a significant height, there is no evidence of structural failure or collapse that would classify it under ""collapse of object."" The sequence of events indicates that the tubing and scaffolding boards were dislodged and fell, directly striking the employee, fitting the description of objects in free fall causing injury."
Employees Unhurt In 20 Ft Fall From Steel Cage,At about 8 a.m. on march 6 1990 employees #1 #2 and #3 were working on a steel cage made from rebar. The cage was the foundation for a concrete column for a bridge support. It was set into a cofferdam and supported by 3/8 in. Guys at each of four corners. One guy failed and employees #1 #2 and #3 fell approximately 20 ft to the bottom of the cofferdam. None of the employees was seriously injured.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the failure of the structural integrity of the steel cage, specifically the failure of one of its supporting guys. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""collapse of object,"" which involves cases starting with structural failure, rather than a simple fall from height. While the employees did fall, this was a consequence of the structural failure rather than an independent fall incident."
Employee Falls From Tower And Dies,At approximately 3:50 p.m. on march 7 2001 employee #1 a crew leader and three coworkers were replacing a 1.625 in. Coax cable on the top of a 400 ft wire guy tower. After climbing the tower employee #1 tied off to the electrical capstan hoist load line. In the process of riding the line down cable snap-ins were removed that secured the old cable to the side of the tower. On the ground the new cable was tied to the hoist line and employee #1 rode the hoist load line back up to the top of the tower where the new cable was temporarily secured. The old cable was tied in to the hoist line at the top of the tower and employee #1 got on the hoist load line and signaled the trainee hoist operator to lower the line. Employee #1 and old cable were lowered about 20 ft when the line stopped sliding around the drum of the capstan hoist. The trainee hoist operator was instructed to remove one of six wraps of rope from the drum. In attempting to remove a wrap the rope line came off the hoist drum and employee #1 and the old cable fell from near the top of the tower to the ground. Employee #1 died.,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The incident described does not indicate a structural failure of the tower itself, which would be necessary for classification under ""collapse of object."" Instead, the accident occurred due to a malfunction of the capstan hoist and the rope coming off the drum, leading to an uncontrolled fall of the employee from a height. This scenario fits the definition of ""falls"" as it involves a descent from an elevation due to a mechanical failure rather than a structural collapse."
Driver Is Killed When Crushed By Pipe,At approximately 8:30 a.m. on june 22 2006 employee #1 a truck driver was helping another driver unload a 60 in. Section of concrete storm sewer pipe (that weighed approximately 12 000 lbs) from a flat bed trailer. A contract employee was operating a front-end loader with a fork attachment to move the pipe. The pipe section rolled off the forks and crushed employee #1 between the truck and the pipe. He was killed. This offloading procedure was routine and was performed frequently. There were no weather factors contributing to the accident. The company had a safety program.,caught in/between objects,collapse of object,错误,"Although the incident involves a heavy object (the pipe) that fell, the primary cause leading to the incident is the worker being crushed between the pipe and the truck. This scenario aligns more closely with the definition of ""caught in/between objects,"" which includes situations where individuals are injured by being trapped or caught between two objects. The collapse of the pipe does not fit the definition of ""collapse of object"" as it did not involve a structural failure."
Employee Killed When Crushed By Land/Rockslide,Employee #1 and three coworkers were preparing a road bed for logging while working alongside a 10 to 15 ton granite boulder. A land/rockslide occurred crushing employee #1 to death.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The incident involves a land/rockslide, which can be interpreted as a failure of the geological structure. This aligns more closely with the ""collapse of object"" category, which involves cases starting with structural failure, rather than the ""struck by falling object"" category, which typically refers to objects falling due to external forces without structural failure. Therefore, the primary cause of the incident is better categorized under ""collapse of object""."
Two Employees Injured In Fall From Unsecured Scaffold,At 10:34 a.m. on december 21 2007 employees #1 and #2 who had started work that day at 8:00 a.m. were on their first and second days respectively at the job site.

Employee'S Finger Is Crush By Falling Metal Catwalk,"At approximately 2:00 p.m. on august 12 2013 employee #1 and a crew were demolishing old structures in a flour packer section of a flourmill. Employee #1 tore apart an l-shape metal catwalk wherein one side of the shorter span of the ""l"" was attached to the longer span by 3 bolt and knots and the other side standing on two legs. He had already removed the three bolt and knots but the span was still in place/suspended maybe due to the long period of being attached. As he tried to grab a hammer under the catwalk the catwalk span suddenly came down crushing his right hand against the concrete floor. Employee #1 was transported to an urgent care clinic where he stayed overnight for observation then was transferred to a medical center where he was treated for his injuries and hospitalized. The incident resulted in the amputation of his right middle finger.",struck by falling object,collapse of object,错误,"Although the employee's finger was crushed between the falling metal catwalk and the concrete floor, the primary cause of the incident was the sudden fall of the metal catwalk. This aligns more closely with the definition of ""struck by falling object,"" where the victim is hit by a falling object from a height, rather than being caught in between objects. The collapse of the catwalk initiated the sequence of events leading to the injury, emphasizing the importance of categorizing based on the primary cause."
Employee Suffers Skull Fractures From Structural Collapse Wi,At approximately 2:10 p.m. on may 22 2013 employee #1 of broken arrow communications was injured while working in a trench when a masonry block wall located parallel with and immediately adjacent to the trench became unstable and collapsed. As the wall fell away from the trench it landed on shrubbery and terrain preventing it from falling flat. The wall now laying at an angle to the ground slid into the trench pinning the head of employee #1 between the concrete footer of the fallen wall and the opposite side wall of the trench. Employees on scene used a back hoe to lift the wall off of employee #1 who was trapped and he collapsed into the trench. Employee #1 was able to crawl out of the trench on his own. Employee #2 a foreman called 911 and units from henderson nevada fire department and henderson police department were dispatched. On arrival fire units found employee #1 laying on the ground in the parking lot to the west of the accident scene. They stabilized employee #1 and transported him via ambulance to sunrise medical center where he underwent surgery to treat skull fractures and nerve damage to his face. Employee #1 was admitted to the trauma intensive care unit on may 22 2013 with a generally positive prognosis.,collapse of object,collapse of object,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the structural failure of the masonry block wall, which collapsed and subsequently pinned the employee between the fallen wall and the side of the trench.

Employee Falls Off Roof And Fractures Arm,On september 23 2013 employee #1 a journeyman plumber was working for a plumbing company and providing services at a residential building. To unclog a drain he needed to access the roof of the building. Employee #1 used an extension ladder to go up to the roof of the one-story house. After completing his work he started descending the ladder when it slipped out. Employee #1 fell onto a concrete driveway below and fractured his left arm. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported him to a medical center where he received treatment and was then hospitalized.,falls,collapse of object,错误,"The primary cause of the incident is the fall itself, which occurs as the employee descends the ladder and slips, leading directly to the injury. Although the ladder slipping could imply a structural issue, the core event aligns more closely with the definition of a fall, where the employee slips and falls to the ground, resulting in a fracture. This matches the examples provided in the ""falls"" category more closely than those in ""collapse of object,"" where structural failures are the primary cause."
Employee Injured In Fall When Scaffold Overturns,On october 13 2006 employee #1 a foreman was working on the wall of a laboratory room at the university of california-davis. He moved a rolling scaffold into one corner of the room to reach the top of the wall. He positioned the scaffold with one wheel resting on a plywood cover that had been placed there by the primary contractor to cover a floor opening. After locking the wheels of the scaffold employee #1 ascended the scaffold and began to work on the wall. Upon completing the job he was starting to descend when he felt the scaffold begin to fall forward causing him to lose his balance. Employee #1 fell to the floor and suffered a fracture to the left side of his skull fractured ribs on his left side and a fracture to the end of his right thumb. Emergency medical personnel responded and employee #1 was transported to the university of david--sacramento where he was hospitalized for four days. Subsequent investigation determined that the plywood cover had shifted and the scaffold wheel had fallen into the hole it was covering.,falls,collapse of object,错误,"Although the scaffold's instability is a contributing factor, the primary cause of the incident is the employee's fall from the scaffold due to its movement.

Electric Shock,A power line crew was installing all dielectric self-supporting fiber-optic cable onto structures supporting an existing 69-kilovolt overhead power line. As part of the project the crew reinforced the existing structures and installed the fiber-optic cable. To install the cable the crew would hang sheaves use a pulling rope to pull the cable through the sheaves and permanently attach the cable to the structure. The employees would reinforce the existing structures by replacing some poles installing additional cross braces below the power line and installing supporting braces above the crossarm. The employees worked with the power line energized some of the time and deenergized at other times. The employer relied on employee work practices to avoid violating the minimum approach distance when the line was energized. However because of the placement of the braces and fiber-optic cable maintaining the minimum approach distance was not possible on most structures. One of the employees was completing the task of clipping in the fiber-optic cable on a two-pole structure while the power line was energized. The employee was attaching the cable to the structure with a housing that included a rubber boot and reinforcing rods. As the employee was wrapping the rods around the cable one of the rods got stuck. When he jerked on the 1.8-meter-long rod to free it it passed too close to the power line and current arced to the rod. The employee was electrocuted and set on fire by the electric arc. His coworkers conducted pole-top rescue lowered him to the ground and administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Their efforts were to no avail as the injured employee was pronounced dead at the scene.,electrocution,electrocution,正确,"The primary incident described in the text involves an employee being electrocuted and set on fire by an electric arc, which aligns closely with the definition of the ""electrocution"" category.

Employee #1 was discharged from the hospital on july 19 2012.",falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee falling through the unguarded skylight opening, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. Although there might be falling debris from the skylight, the core incident is the fall itself, not being struck by the falling object, thus adhering to the principle of selecting the primary cause."
Employee Falls From A Roof,On may 21 2013 employee #1 of rafael construction inc. climbed out of a man basket onto a first story roof area and walked a short distance to the metal roof awning area on the building. Employee #1 stepped on a perforated metal sheet of the metal roof awning that gave way under his weight and fell approximately 13 feet to the grade of earth and gravel below. Employee #1 sustained serious injuries that required more than 24 hours of hospitalization.,falls,falls,正确,"Although the perforated metal sheet collapsed under the employee's weight, the primary cause of the incident as per the principle outlined is the fall from elevation. The collapse of the metal sheet directly precipitated the fall, but the defining event that resulted in injury was the fall itself, fitting the definition of the ""falls"" category more closely than ""collapse of object."""
Foreman Is Injured In Fall,On april 22 2004 employee #1 a foreman with a roofing crew was preparing to remove and replace the existing roofing system on a 147-ft by 50-ft structure. He began to sweep the gravel ballast from the roof using a power broom before any fall protection was provided. While he was making a pass with his back to the edge of the roof the machine's drive wheel belt came off the pulleys. The foreman was pushed back and fell 21.5 ft to a paved area. He was hospitalized for fractured ankles.,falls,falls,正确,"Although the foreman lost balance due to the power broom's malfunction, the primary cause leading to the injury was the fall itself. The definition of ""falls"" includes incidents where the victim falls from elevation, which aligns with the scenario where the foreman fell 21.5 ft to a paved area. The classification principle emphasizes selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, and in this case, the fall is the direct cause of the injury."
Crew Leader Is Killed In Fall From Unguarded Platform,At approximately 10:05 a.m. on march 8 2013 employee #1 a carpentry crew leader employed by har construction co. llc was working at a construction site where a new six-story apartment complex with two stories of underground parking was being built. He was wearing a hard hat and had on his carpenter's belt. He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches wide and was not guarded on the north south and east sides. A gust of wind or some other factor caused employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to a concrete floor area on the third floor below a distance of approximately 10 feet 8.25 inches. He apparently did not strike or hit anything as he fell. He landed between two 2-foot by 4-foot wood braces that were positioned 5 feet 1.25 inches apart on the third floor. He landed face down striking his head on the concrete floor approximately 4 feet 4 inches from a wood framed wall. Employee #1's fall was witnessed by coworker #1 who was working on the third floor. Coworker #1 went to employee #1 and got no response. He then went and got help from one or more others at the work site. When they returned employee #1 was still unresponsive. There was a considerable amount of blood pooled around employee #1's head. Rescue personnel were called and when they arrived they pronounced employee #1 dead at the scene from massive head trauma. The subsequent investigation established that clark builders group llc was the general contractor for this work project. One of the subcontractors was agility construction llc which had the framing contract. Agility subcontracted all of the framing work to har construction co. llc with which agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the har employees) and the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager for agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the clark builders group officials. Har construction co. llc had 52 employees working at this site. They had been at the site since early january 2013. There were two foremen two crew leaders 16 carpenters and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for har construction co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall employee #1 was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the investigation coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00 a.m. when employee #1 while still up on the fourth floor walked over near the work area on the third floor where coworker #1 was working. Coworker #1 told employee #1 that they needed one more 2-foot by 4-foot piece of lumber and that there were no more on the third floor. Employee #1 went back to an area on the fourth floor that was enclosed by guardrails and picked up a piece of lumber from a lumber stack. He then handed the lumber down to coworker #1 from either inside or outside the guarded area. After coworker #1 took the lumber employee #1 told coworker #1 he was going to come down to the third floor using the job-made wood ladder that was at the east end of the platform nearby. Within seconds employee #1 fell from the south side of the fourth floor platform to a concrete floor area on the third floor. All of the building's floors were made of wood except this concrete section on t,falls,falls,正确,"The incident primarily describes the employee falling from an unguarded platform without any indication that he was struck by a falling object. The text emphasizes the lack of guarding on the platform leading to the fall, aligning closely with the definition of a fall rather than being struck by a falling object."
Employee Falls From Elevation And Is Killed,On july 9 2003 employee #1 of abl inc. was walking atop a plywood walkway which was supported by planking between the bottom flanges of the i-beams of a bridge deck. Apparently one of the 4-in. By 8-in. Sheets of plywood slipped off the supports and as employee #1 stepped on it fell 50 ft to the ground. Employee #1 was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"Although the plywood slipping off can be interpreted as a form of structural failure, the primary incident described is the employee falling from an elevated position after stepping on the unstable walkway. This aligns more closely with the definition of falls, which includes incidents where the victim falls from an elevation without involving structural failure. The collapse of object category typically involves initial structural failures leading to secondary effects like falls, but here the emphasis is on the fall itself due to the walkway's instability."
Employee Is Killed In Fall From Beam,On may 23 2008 employee #1 an iron worker on a construction site was working from an i-beam. He was using an impact wrench to tighten bolts on the i-beam when he fell 42 feet from the beam. He sustained chest injury and was killed. He had not been using fall protection.,falls,falls,正确,"The text describes the incident where the employee fell 42 feet from an i-beam while working, and there is no indication of an object falling and striking the employee. This aligns more closely with the ""falls"" category, which involves incidents where the victim falls from an elevation. The top-3 similar samples for the ""falls"" category further support this classification as they describe scenarios involving workers falling from elevated positions without being struck by any falling objects."
Worker Demolishing Building Falls And Fractures Leg,At approximately 8:15 a.m. on july 23 2013 employee #1 of aa max quality construction a residential construction company was engaged in demolition work at a fire-damaged residential building. He climbed a step ladder and then onto a 10-foot tall wall in order to cut the fire-damaged ceiling supports. He was using a reciprocating saw. He lost his balance and fell from the wall a distance of 10 feet. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital admitted and treated for a fractured left leg. During its subsequent investigation cal/osha determined that employee #1 had not been using fall protection.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee losing balance and falling from the wall, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. Although there is a mention of a reciprocating saw being used, there is no indication that a falling object directly caused the fall. The scenario fits best with the examples provided under the ""falls"" category where individuals lose their balance or fall from heights due to various reasons unrelated to being struck by a falling object."
Hvac Installer Is Seriously Injured In Fall From Roof,At approximately 8:30 a.m. on october 26 2012 employee #1 of bay air systems inc. was working at a multiemployer construction site a 24 hour fitness building. He and three coworkers were on the roof and laying out huge hvac machinery. The machinery was being lifted by helicopter from the ground to the roof. According to employee #1 he was standing on the corner end of the building and looking up at the helicopter waiting for the machinery to be lowered. He moved sideways. He later reported that as he moved he felt he was stepping onto the steel cover of a 24-inch square opening in the roof. He fell through the opening to concrete below. He was transported to eden medical center in castro valley where he was admitted and treated for five days for serious injuries. His injuries included but were not limited to fractured ribs fractured collar bone and fractured spine.,falls,falls,正确,"Although the accident involves stepping onto a cover of an opening that led to a fall, the primary cause of the incident is the employee's fall from elevation through an opening, which aligns more closely with the 'falls' category definition. The collapse of the cover does not indicate a structural failure of the entire object or system, but rather a specific instance of falling through an unprotected opening, making 'falls' the more appropriate category according to the given classification principle."
Employee Killed In Fall From Bridge Pier,Employee #1 was assigned to make cuts in horizontal 24 in. Wide bridge beams under metal decking with concrete fill. Using an oxy-acetylene torch he was to burn approximately 6 in. Down approximately 14 ft across and approximately 6 in. Up again for each cut. Employee #1 was working from atop a concrete pier under the bridge decking and had limited crawl space and height. He had almost completed cutting on his first beam when he apparently tripped on material that had accumulated from a small break at the edge of the concrete pier or from some related cause. He pulled on the hose and then lost his balance and footing due to slack in the crossbracing of the bridge support. Employee #1 fell from the bridge pier and was killed. It is possible that hot sparks or insects also contributed to this accident. Employee #1 was not wearing a safety belt or lanyard nor was a net furnished. There were no eyewitnesses.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the employee losing balance and falling from an elevated position, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. Although there is mention of material accumulation at the edge of the concrete pier which could imply being struck by something, the core event leading to the employee's death is a fall from height, not being struck by a falling object. Therefore, the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident leads to categorizing this incident under ""falls""."
Employee Is Killed In Fall From Roof,On april 18 2005 employee #1 was part of an asbestos removal crew removing the old roof from a building. It consisted of metal panels and sections of glass windows reinforced with chicken wire. Employee #1 was wearing a harness and lanyard but was not tied off. He was unscrewing the bolts of one of the panels when he stepped backward and fell through the glass to the ground below. The distance from the roof to the ground was approximately 46 feet. He was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the employee's fall from the roof, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. Although the glass panel breaking contributed to the fall, the core incident is categorized as a fall from elevation, not due to being struck by a falling object. The top similar samples for the ""falls"" category further support this categorization, as they describe scenarios where individuals fall from heights without structural failures leading to the falls."
Employee Is Injured In Fall Off Shear Wall,At approximately 12:30 pm. On july 12 2011 employee # 1 of harris salinas rebar inc. was repositioning himself on a shear wall on the new u.n.r. Living learning community (bld #004) reno nevada. The shear wall which was located on the northwest end of the project was approximately 40 feet in height with an excavated trench located below on the north side of the wall. Employee # 1 was working his way down the wall when he stopped to tie an area off apparently only connecting his one positioning hook and not his lanyard. Employee # 1 continued to work on the rebar when his positioning hook slid off the horizontal rebar member which had not been completely tied off at the intersection and fell to the north landing in the trench. Employee # 1 fell approximately 45 feet into the trench suffering injuries including fractured ribs.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the employee falling from the shear wall after his positioning hook slid off the rebar, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. There is no indication that the employee was struck by a falling object during or after the fall, which would be necessary to classify the incident under ""struck by falling object."" Therefore, based on the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, ""falls"" is the correct category."

As he was climbing onto the roof of a single-story home to place his anchor he fell onto the flat roof of a garage below and then onto a concrete sidewalk. He sustained a serious head injury and fractured facial bones.,falls,falls,正确,"The text describes an incident where the employee fell from the roof to the garage and then to the concrete sidewalk. This sequence of events aligns closely with the definition of ""falls"" which involves slip, trip cases and where the victim is falling from elevation. There is no mention of the employee being struck by a falling object, making ""struck by falling object"" an inappropriate classification according to the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident."
Employee Trips On Steel Pipe And Breaks Hip,On january 11 2006 employee #1 was carrying a box from the front office to the back of the building into the shop. He placed the box on the work bench and turned to return to the front office. As employee #1 was walking past the work bench he tripped over 20 to 25 pieces of 20-ft steel piping that was lying on the floor in front of the work bench. Employee #1 fell to the ground and broke his hip. He was hospitalized for 10 days.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was the employee tripping over the steel pipes, which led to a fall. Although the steel pipes caused the trip, they did not fall from a height, which would be necessary for categorizing the incident under ""struck by falling object"". Therefore, the incident best fits under ""falls"" as it involves a trip case resulting in a fall from the ground level."
Employee Injured In Fall From Elevation,"Employee #1 was working as an apprentice steel worker. Employee #1 was using a manual ""crimper"" to join 3-ft by 28-ft steel deck panels together to form a floor. Employee #2 the foreman had warned employee #1 not to work walking backward but employee #1 continued to do so. Employee #1 walked backward into an unguarded stairwell opening falling 8 ft to the concrete landing and then another 8 ft 2in. To the concrete floor. Employee #1 suffered a fractured skull and a fractured back and was hospitalized.",falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident was Employee #1 falling from an elevation after walking backward into an unguarded stairwell opening, which aligns with the definition of falls. Although there is an element of interaction with a stationary object (the stairwell opening), the core incident described is a fall from height, making ""falls"" the most appropriate category according to the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident."
Employee Killed In Fall From Air Shaft,At approximately 11:45 a.m. on april 18 2002 employee #1 was removing a cover called a form from an air shaft. He fell 90 ft to the bottom of the shaft and was killed. The form was constructed of two 4-by-4s and a 3-by-4 sheet of 0.75-in. Plywood. The form was secured in place with four ellis jacks.,falls,falls,正确,"The text describes an incident where the primary cause leading to the employee's death was a fall from a significant height (90 ft) through an air shaft. The act of removing the cover did not directly cause the fall; rather, it was the act of falling itself that resulted in the fatal injury. This aligns more closely with the ""falls"" category definition, which involves incidents where the victim is falling from an elevation,不同于由物体坠落引起的打击。虽然员工在移除盖子的过程中发生了事故，但主要原因是坠落，而不是被物体击中。因此，根据选择导致事故的主要原因的原则，“falls”类别是最合适的分类。"

As he worked he fell through a floor opening in the walking way of the underdeck. He landed 20 ft below and struck the stripped material. Employee #1 sustained numerous serious injuries to his legs lower back and head. Emergency medical personnel were summoned and transported him to a medical center where he received treatment and was hospitalized.,falls,falls,正确,"The incident primarily involves the employee falling through a floor opening, which aligns more closely with the definition of ""falls"" as it does not explicitly indicate a structural failure or collapse of the floor itself, but rather a fall from an elevation. The top similar samples for ""falls"" also support this classification, where employees fall from heights due to openings or other non-structural reasons."
Employee Dies In Fall Through Air Duct,Employee #1 a journeyman electrician at a construction site had been employed since august 13 1991. He left the ground floor work location to determine the reason for a power failure on the sixth floor. He fell 34 ft through an open 6 ft by 9 ft air duct shaft before reaching the sixth floor. Employee #1 died. Circumstances causing the fall remain unknown. Because work was not in progress workers were not on the mezzanine-level entry to witness the employee's fall through the air duct shaft.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the employee falling through an open air duct shaft, which directly corresponds to the ""falls"" category definition involving slip, trip cases, and falling from elevation. Although there is a potential confusion point regarding the duct cover, the core incident described is the fall itself, not being struck by a falling object. Therefore, based on the principle of selecting the primary cause, the category ""falls"" is the most appropriate classification."

The weight of his safety belt kept him under water and he drowned. He was not wearing a life vest.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the fall from the bridge tower, which aligns with the definition of the ""falls"" category. Although the ultimate consequence was drowning, the initiating event and primary hazard was the fall itself, not the drowning, which occurred as a secondary consequence of the fall into water. The top similar samples for the ""falls"" category also predominantly describe incidents where the main event was a fall from a height, consistent with the given scenario."
Drywall Installer Falls From Scissor Lift And Injures Head,On may 7 2013 employee #1 employed by a drywall contractor was working at a commercial warehouse building.

The winch manufacturer required the unit to be ""in gear"" for this operation. However the employee used the brake only. The load did not stop and crashed through the platform floor creating a hole approximately 10 feet by 5 feet. The employee on the platform fell into the hole and struck his head on the structural steel as he fell into the bay. The employee was killed.",falls,falls,正确,"Although the incident was triggered by the jacking frame falling and creating a hole, the immediate cause of the employee's death was the fall into the bay through the hole. According to the principle of selecting the primary cause that led to the incident, the classification should focus on the final action that resulted in the injury, which is the fall itself. Therefore, ""falls"" is the more appropriate category."

Employee Fall From Roof,On march 2 2004 at approximately 1220 hours the cal/ osha oakland district office employee #1 a carpenter 47 years old was bolting a beam to a concrete wall on the ground floor of a two-story building under construction. Instead of fully opening the ladder he partially opened it and propped it against the concrete floor with employee #1 falling down with it as a result he sustained closed pelvis pubis and sacral fractures. Employee #1 was hospitalized for about 25 hours for medical examination and observation.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the improper setup and use of the ladder, leading to a fall of the employee. Although the ladder did collapse, the core issue is the fall itself due to the unsafe working conditions, fitting the definition of ""falls"" rather than ""struck by falling object,"" which would imply the employee was hit by a separate falling object."
Employee Killed In Fall Through Roof Opening,On october 30 2007 employee #1 was repairing the sheet metal on a low-sloped roof. He removed a sheet metal panel and accidentally stepped into the opening falling approximately 28 ft to the floor of the building. Employee #1 was killed.,falls,falls,正确,"The text describes an incident where the employee accidentally stepped into an opening in the roof and fell 28 feet to the floor, which aligns closely with the definition of ""falls"" involving slips, trips, and falls from elevation not due to structural failure. Although the opening gave way, the primary cause of the incident was the fall itself, not an object falling onto the employee, thus it does not fit the ""struck by falling object"" category."
Employee Falls Into Trench And Is Injured,At approximately 10:41 a.m. on november 5 2013 employee #1 and a coworker were uncovering a trench which had water pipes laid into the trench. The trench was about 6 ft deep 7 ft wide and 12 ft long covered by three heavy metal plates. Both employees were using a mobile crane mounted on a truck to lift the metal plates one by one. However after lifting up the first metal plate the employees realized that load was not as stable as it should be. Therefore the coworker told employee #1 to extend the outriggers of the crane and set up wood cribbing underneath the footing of the outriggers because the crane-truck was parked on a slightly sloped area. Employee #1 had his back towards the open trench while he was sitting on the ground and was setting up the cribbing. Employee # 1 was about 4.5 ft away from the open trench while cribbing. As he finished the cribbing and got up he forgot about the open trench behind him and took two to three steps backwards falling into the trench. He struck his back on a valve attached to the water pipes which were about 3 ft high above the trench surface. Employee #1 suffered serious injuries to his spine and he was hospitalized for approximately three days at a medical center.,falls,falls,正确,"The primary cause of the incident described is the employee falling into the trench, which aligns with the definition of falls involving slips and trips leading to a fall from elevation. Although the employee struck his back on a valve after falling, the initial and primary action that led to the injury was the fall itself, not being struck by a moving object."

Employee #1 was using a harness and retractable lanyard attached to a roof anchor when he fell. The force of the fall pulled the anchor away from the decking to which it was attached allowing the employee to fall. Employee #1 was killed in the fall.,falls,falls,正确,"Although the anchor point's failure contributed to the fall, the primary incident described is the roofer falling from a significant height. The definitions and examples provided under ""falls"" highlight incidents where individuals fall from heights, often due to improper or disconnected safety equipment, which closely matches the scenario described in the text. The ""collapse of object"" category focuses more on structural failures leading to falls, such as collapsing roofs or scaffolds, which does not precisely fit the situation where the anchor point failed but did not involve the structural failure of the entire object or surface the worker was on."
Employees Injured By Unplanned Detonation,Some employees were excavating a hole for an electric light pole. They had drilled two holes and loaded them with two to five sticks of 40 percent dynamite. They were using a 6-volt battery to detonate the dynamite when an unplanned detonation occurred injuring both employees. They were hospitalized for their injuries.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"Although the dynamite explosion resulted in debris that could have struck the employees, the primary cause of the incident was the unplanned detonation of dynamite, which fits the definition of an injury caused by an explosion.

While attempting to shut off the valve on the acetylene cylinder employee #1 suffered a burn to his arm.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"Although the incident resulted in a burn, which could suggest exposure to extreme temperatures, the primary cause of the incident was the regulator valve on the acetylene cylinder shooting out a flame. This scenario aligns closely with the definition of ""fires and explosion,"" which includes injuries caused by direct fires. The involvement of a flaming regulator during a plumbing operation indicates a fire-related event rather than mere exposure to extreme temperatures without the presence of a fire."
Employee Burned When Vapors From Bonding Adhesive Ignite,On july 30 2007 employee #1 and six coworkers were installing roofing materials including insulation and sheets of rubber membranes on the flat roof of a commercial building. The crew was spreading epdm bonding adhesive from 5-gallon pails to adhere the insulation and rubber sheets together. At one point the vapors from the highly flammable bonding agent ignited in the area where employee #1 was working. He suffered first- and second-degree burns to his right forearm and he was transported to the hospital for treatment. Six to eight of the empty bonding agent containers were left uncovered which allowed vapors to escape that contributed to the main cause of the fire. The ambient temperature was in the high 90s f and the humidity was high. The material safety data sheet and the buckets' labels clearly stated that all containers were to be covered while not in use and that vapors from the bonding agent could be readily ignited by static electricity.,fires and explosion,fires and explosion,正确,"The primary cause of the incident is the ignition of flammable vapors from the bonding adhesive, which directly led to a fire and subsequent burns to the employee. This scenario aligns more closely with the definition of ""fires and explosion,"" which includes injuries caused by direct fires, rather than ""exposure to extreme temperatures,"" which typically refers to injuries from extreme environmental temperatures or hot liquids/gases without the presence of a fire."

Telecommunication Worker Is Killed In Fall From Aerial Lift,On july 23 2012 employee #1 and two coworkers were installing a guy for a utilility pole across the intersection of central avenue pike and beaver creek lane in knoxville tennessee. One coworker was a flagger and the other was a lineman. The flagger was out on central avenue pike to control traffic on central avenue pike before a section of cable was laid across the intersection. Employee #1 used an aerial lift to attach one end of the guy to the utility pole on the west side of central avenue pike. Employee #1 boomed down and the truck was moved to another utility pole on beaver creek lane. The crew made sure that there was enough slack in the cable so that the cable would lie flat across the intersection. Employee #1 raised the bucket to an estimated height of 15 feet (4.6 meters) in order to hang the guy on the utility pole. At that point employee #1 saw that he had connected the guy on the south side of a fiber optic cable that was installed diagonally across beaver creek lane when it needed to be on the north side. Employee #1 boomed down and asked the lineman to hand him the cable. Employee #1 had the flagger put down the flagging sign come over to the bucket truck cut the cable from the reel and hand it to him. The flagger left the roadway walked across the street and cut the cable using a pair of bolt cutters. Employee #1 had the cable in his hand but not the end of the cable. He was going try to get it over the fiber optic cable line. Employee #1 boomed up to an estimated height of 20 feet (6.1 meters) and jerked the cable up which reduced the slack in the cable that was supposed to be lying flat across central avenue pike. Before the flagger or lineman could get back to the roadway they heard noises. A pickup truck traveling southbound on central avenue pike drove over the cable and the cable became caught in its rear bumper. The lineman took off running to an open field but he was hit in the back by the cable 5 or 6 times. Employee #1 who was not wearing a harness or lanyard fell approximately 20 feet (6.1 meters) to the ground. The coworkers came over to the bucket truck and saw employee #1 lying on the ground. The lineman called emergency medical services and local law enforcement and first responders arrived. Employee #1 was transported to the university of tennessee medical center in knoxville tn.
